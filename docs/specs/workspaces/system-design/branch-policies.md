# Branch policies system design

## Summary

A branch policy is repository-owned configuration. Task creation sends a policy
ID, the backend resolves it, and the resulting task-repository row owns an
immutable snapshot. Repository settings manage policies through immediate CRUD,
while task creation shows policies and Git branches as typed option groups in
the existing selector.

This extends, rather than replaces, the repository
`worktree_branch_template`. That field remains the compatibility fallback for
raw branch selections and pre-policy tasks.

## Domain model

Add `repository_branch_policies`:

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable UUID. |
| `repository_id` | Required repository owner; delete cascades from repository. |
| `name` | Trimmed display name, 1 to 100 characters. |
| `description` | Optional text, at most 500 characters. |
| `base_branch` | Safe Git ref used as task base. |
| `branch_template` | Template validated and rendered by `internal/worktree`. |
| `pull_request_target` | Safe Git ref; omitted on create defaults to base, omitted on update preserves saved target, explicit blank resets to effective base. |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | UTC timestamps. |

A unique index on `(repository_id, lower(name))` enforces name uniqueness. Lists
sort by case-folded name and stable ID. The table is part of both the SQLite
base schema and replayable SQLite/Postgres migrations.

Extend `task_repositories` with snapshot fields:

- `branch_policy_id`;
- `branch_policy_name`;
- `worktree_branch_template`;
- `pull_request_target`.

`base_branch` already stores the selected base. The policy ID is historical
provenance, not a foreign key. This keeps the complete snapshot after a policy
is deleted. Empty values identify raw-branch and legacy rows.

## Backend boundaries

### Repository policy service

The task repository interface gains list, get, create, update, delete, and
atomic Gitflow-starter operations. The service owns:

- workspace/repository authorization;
- normalized validation and case-insensitive conflicts;
- defaulting the target on creation and preserving update field presence;
- branch-template validation through the existing renderer;
- transactions and structured mutation logs.

The Gitflow starter accepts only production and development branch refs. It
checks that both refs are present in the current local or remote branch list,
checks that the repository has no policies inside the same transaction, and
inserts all four policies or none. The branch can still disappear after this
check, so task creation and later runtime operations retain their existing
missing-branch recovery behavior.

### Atomic starter admission

AC-WORKSPACES-BRANCH-POLICIES-002.3, 002.4 and 002.6 require one repository-scoped
conditional operation. The production insert inventory is
`sqlite.Repository.CreateRepositoryBranchPoliciesIfEmpty` and
`sqlite.Repository.CreateRepositoryBranchPolicy` in `repository_branch_policy.go`.
The Gitflow and ordinary-create service methods, registered REST routes and WS
actions converge on those writers. `repository.Provide` returns the concrete
store; there is no separate branch-policy forwarder. Both writers participate
in the same transaction admission boundary, including direct store callers.

Begin a writer transaction and acquire admission before the first canonical
predicate read or insert. PostgreSQL uses
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended($1, 0))` with the dedicated namespace
`repository-branch-policy-admission:` plus repository ID. SQLite uses a
repository-scoped no-op write to `repository_branch_policies` (`SET id = id`
with `WHERE repository_id = ?`) before the initial read; even an empty result
obtains the database writer lock across independent pools. Keep this operation
transaction-bound and roll it back with every failure. SQLite retains its
existing database-wide writer serialization; PostgreSQL uses separate keys
for different repositories. A per-service mutex or pool size is insufficient.

The admitted starter reads the canonical count on the transaction. Any positive
count returns `repoerrors.ErrRepositoryBranchPoliciesExist` before insertion.
Otherwise insert the complete service-generated four-policy set and commit
before reporting success. An ordinary create takes the same admission lock
and inserts its single policy without an empty-set condition. It can therefore
precede the starter (which rejects) or follow it (which permits a distinct
custom policy). Preserve service Git branch listing, production/default-branch
and development/`develop` defaults, trimming, safe refs and existing tuples.
The ordinary service's existing name lookup remains a preflight check; the
transaction insert and named uniqueness constraint determine its final result.

Reuse the narrow `isBranchPolicyNameConflict` classifier and existing
`repoerrors.ErrRepositoryBranchPolicyNameConflict` for an actual named
case-insensitive uniqueness failure, including an ordinary create whose name
collides after waiting. Insert classification also requires a typed PostgreSQL
constraint error or SQLite unique-constraint code, so an unrelated trigger
message containing the index name remains a storage failure. Only an observed
nonempty starter predicate means already seeded. Primary-key, foreign-key, cancellation, connection and commit
errors retain their existing failure semantics; do not classify all SQL errors
or every `23505` as already seeded. No aborted-transaction reread is used to
invent a conflict. PostgreSQL remains on the established read-committed path.

Repository/policy deletion retains existing cascade and affected-row behavior;
a deleted parent is not recreated. Full legacy writes and per-policy patches
do not add rows and need no admission lock. Preserve the patch namespace
`repository-branch-policy:` plus policy ID, canonical row lock, pure effective
normalizer and omitted-field ownership. No new nested lock order, schema,
interface, ETag, global revision, retry framework or general concurrency engine
is needed. Admission ends at commit/rollback, independent of event publication.

### Atomic partial policy updates

The patch repair implements AC-WORKSPACES-BRANCH-POLICIES-001.7 through
001.10. `UpdateRepositoryBranchPolicyRequest` and the REST/WS update bodies
already carry five optional string pointers. Keep those pointers through a
proposed `models.RepositoryBranchPolicyPatch` and a policy-specific
`PatchRepositoryBranchPolicy` repository operation. JSON null and omission both
decode to nil today; neither introduces a new reset operation. Empty description
clears the description. Empty target explicitly requests the existing reset.

`Service.UpdateRepositoryBranchPolicy` retains workspace membership and writable
repository checks. Its initial read establishes authorized repository identity,
not a candidate for persistence. The patch operation receives that repository
ID and rejects any missing or mismatched canonical row. The concrete provider
returns `sqlite.Repository` directly; there is no branch-policy forwarding layer.

Use one transaction for the canonical read, patch, normalization, uniqueness
check, update and result. PostgreSQL first takes
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended($1, 0))` using the dedicated namespace
`repository-branch-policy:` plus policy ID, before any canonical read or update;
then lock the policy row for update. The row lock also coordinates with retained
full writes and deletes that do not take the advisory lock. SQLite first obtains
its writer lock by an identity-scoped no-op update (`SET id = id`), before reading
the row. The single connection per writer pool alone does not coordinate
independent pools. The scoped lock/read/write includes both policy ID and
authorized repository ID. Use transaction-bound queries, never the reader pool.

Overlay supplied pointers on the locked current row and invoke the existing
service normalizer on that complete effective policy. A single policy-specific
pure normalization function parameter keeps ref/template/length validation in
the service without importing service into storage or moving worktree-dependent
validation into models. It performs no database, event or other external work;
this is not a generic mutation callback framework. Nil target retains the saved
target; a supplied blank target defaults to the overlaid current base. Creation
continues to use the same normalizer's original default behavior. Make update
normalization presence-aware: only a supplied blank target invokes reset
on update. An omitted legacy blank target must not silently reset; complete
validation rejects an invalid effective row without writing.

Check normalized name uniqueness inside the transaction, excluding this policy,
and retain the existing case-insensitive database constraint for competing policy
identities and creates. Translate both observed and constraint conflicts to the
existing service conflict error. An advisory lock on one policy cannot serialize
all repository names. Write the normalized locked candidate, preserve identity
and creation time, check affected rows, and capture the full result inside the
transaction. Return it only after commit succeeds. Rollback includes the initial
SQLite lock write and timestamp on any failure. Keep the existing intentional
whole-set `UpdateRepositoryBranchPolicy` store method compatible for direct
callers; the partial service path must not forward a stale full row to it.

This follows existing transaction/locking patterns in `message_agent_plan.go`
and the presence boundary of `PatchRepositorySet`; branch-policy defaults and
whole-policy validation require a current row. No schema change, ETag, global
revision, service mutex, general concurrency framework or new public endpoint
is needed. Create, delete and the Gitflow initializer retain their current
semantics. The existing zero-affected-row guard already handles deletion.

### API and events

Expose:

- `GET /api/v1/repositories/{repository_id}/branch-policies`;
- `POST /api/v1/repositories/{repository_id}/branch-policies`;
- `POST /api/v1/repositories/{repository_id}/branch-policies/gitflow`;
- `PATCH /api/v1/repository-branch-policies/{policy_id}`;
- `DELETE /api/v1/repository-branch-policies/{policy_id}`.

REST and WebSocket transports call the same service methods. Semantic
`repository_branch_policy.created`, `.updated`, and `.deleted` events keep
clients synchronized. The active-workspace boot payload includes policies
grouped by repository so task creation does not add a first-open request.

Responses and `repository_branch_policy.updated` publish the patch transaction's
complete normalized result after commit, including its timestamps. Do not
publish the pre-transaction candidate or reread through the reader pool to form
the result. This is an observation of this mutation's committed row, not a
promise that it remains the latest row when delivered or that independent
publishers deliver events in commit order. Failed mutations publish no success.

Conflicts return `409`; invalid refs, templates, or Gitflow pairs return a
validation error; an inaccessible or cross-repository policy is indistinguishable
from not found.

`CreateGitflowRepositoryBranchPolicies` maps the store's existence sentinel to
`ErrRepositoryBranchPolicyAlreadySeeded`; `branchPolicyStatus` and `wsError`
already map that domain error to REST `409` and `ws.ErrorCodeConflict`.
Registered `POST /api/v1/repositories/:id/branch-policies/gitflow` and
`ws.ActionRepositoryBranchPolicyGitflow` must exercise that real path. Only
after the store commits does the service publish four
`repository_branch_policy.created` events. A losing or failed starter publishes
none. Responses/events contain the winning normalized tuples and persisted
identities/timestamps (with the existing transport timestamp precision).
This does not promise global event ordering or durable delivery after an event
bus failure.

### Task creation and snapshot resolution

Add optional `branch_policy_id` to each task repository input. In the task-create
transaction, the service:

1. loads the selected repository under the authorized workspace;
2. loads the policy by ID and verifies repository ownership;
3. copies its name, base, template, and pull-request target to
   `task_repositories`;
4. creates no task if any selected policy cannot be resolved.

The backend ignores any browser-derived policy template or target. A policy
selection supplies its base branch authoritatively, even though the UI also
shows that base for feedback.

Runtime worktree creation, local fresh-branch creation, and title-triggered
branch rename read the task snapshot first. They read the repository template
only when the snapshot template is empty. The web pull-request flow reads the
snapshot target first and then the task base branch.

The orchestrator also derives trusted agent context from policy-backed
task-repository snapshots. The context lists the repository, working branch,
and pull-request target. It tells agents to pass the target to the provider CLI
instead of inferring it from the base branch. First launches and agent-context
resets receive the context. Office agents receive the same trusted block.
Passthrough agents receive a compact plain-text instruction because they do not
receive hidden Kandev system blocks. Raw-branch tasks add no instruction.

Prompt construction reads only the task snapshot. It does not read the live
policy. Repeated record-and-launch wrapping replaces the same hidden target
block, so the agent receives one copy. Agent skills and shell environments do
not receive a separate target value.

For AC-WORKSPACES-BRANCH-POLICIES-004.7, task creation after the patch calls finish
resolves the complete committed tuple through `validateTaskRepositoryPolicies`
in `service_task_branch_policy_snapshot.go`. Verify via actual `CreateTask` and
persisted `TaskRepository` rows, including the pre-existing row's preservation;
checking only resolver inputs is insufficient. This repair does not redefine
task creation that overlaps a policy mutation or rewrite snapshot consumers.

## Frontend state and transport

Add a repository-policy API domain and a `repositoryBranchPolicies` store slice
keyed by repository ID. Boot hydration and semantic events update the same
slice. Store mutations occur only after API success.

The existing `toBranchPolicyPayload` preserves undefined-field omission, while
the settings editor deliberately sends complete drafts. Retain both contracts.
This backend state repair changes no rendered surface, mobile composition,
touch behavior or localized copy; registered REST/WS tests and real task
persistence cover the changed outcome without browser tests.

Task repository draft rows add a tagged selection:

```ts
type TaskRepositoryBranchSelection =
  | { kind: "branch"; branch: string }
  | { kind: "policy"; policyId: string; baseBranch: string };
```

The submit adapter converts the tagged selection to `base_branch` plus optional
`branch_policy_id`. It never recognizes a policy by label. Last-used repository
and raw branch behavior stays backend-owned under ADR 0028; the first release
does not persist a last-used policy.

## Repository settings experience

Each saved repository editor contains a collapsed `Branch policies` disclosure
with a count. Expanded content has one visible explanatory sentence, the policy
list, Add policy, and, when empty, Add Gitflow policies. Policies use immediate
modal CRUD and a delete confirmation, so they do not register a dirty settings
contributor or add a local Save button.

The policy form contains name, optional description, base branch, branch
template, and pull-request target. Every technical field has concise visible
supporting text. Focusable info controls explain examples, template placeholders,
and how base differs from pull-request target. Base and target fields reuse the
task branch option model: local refs keep their short names, remote refs keep
their remote prefix, and badges distinguish their source. The shared selector
provides filtering and force-refresh. A saved ref that disappeared remains a
temporary option while the user edits the policy.

Desktop uses a dialog. At phone breakpoints the same form logic renders in a
full-height drawer with one scrolling body and a safe-area footer. Help uses a
tooltip/popover for fine pointers and the established touch drawer pattern for
coarse pointers. The disclosure and list remain inline in the repository
editor; list actions meet the 44 CSS pixel touch target.

The Gitflow starter is a separate guided dialog/drawer with production and
development branch selectors and a preview of the four resulting policies.

## Task-create experience

Extend the existing branch `Pill` selector to accept typed grouped options. It
shows `Branch policies` first and `Branches` second. A policy row keeps its name,
localized `Policy` badge, and information control on one line. Hover or keyboard
focus opens the base, template, target, and unavailable-base details on fine
pointers; tap opens the same details in a drawer on coarse pointers. The closed
chip renders a compact policy name plus base branch.

On a local executor, choosing a policy explicitly enables the existing `Fork a
new branch` state. It does not bypass dirty-tree consent. Choosing a raw branch
restores the existing semantics. A policy with a base branch known missing from
the latest branch list is disabled with repair guidance.

The shared New Task/New Subtask repository picker gets this behavior. Quick Chat,
Remote URL, unsaved-path discovery, Add Sources, and Add Branch do not.

On phone, the existing task selector remains a popover because it is already a
compact, viewport-contained selection surface. Policy rows keep one-line
identity and use a touch drawer for their detailed preview.

## Accessibility and localization

- Disclosure triggers expose expanded state and policy count.
- Group labels, badges, help triggers, field descriptions, errors, and
  confirmations use translations.
- Help triggers are focusable, have accessible names, and expose equivalent
  content by hover, focus, and tap.
- Dialog and drawer focus management uses existing shadcn primitives.
- English copy is added to all supported locale catalogs; Traditional Chinese
  variants use the repository conversion workflow.

## Failure and recovery

- A stale/deleted policy at submit fails task creation atomically. The client
  refreshes policies, keeps the dialog open, and asks the user to choose again.
- A policy base that disappeared after creation follows current worktree launch
  recovery; Kandev does not rewrite the policy.
- A failed CRUD mutation leaves the confirmed list unchanged and shows the
  backend error.
- Concurrent Gitflow starter and ordinary-create admission is serialized before
  the canonical empty-set read. A losing starter receives a typed conflict;
  constraints remain a backstop rather than the admission mechanism.

## Security and observability

Policy reads and writes use repository membership authorization. IDs from other
workspaces do not reveal existence. Templates remain data for the safe renderer;
they are not shell fragments.

Structured logs cover policy mutations, Gitflow starter results, task policy
resolution, and compatibility fallback. Logs include identifiers, not policy
descriptions. No new production metric is introduced initially.

## Migration and rollout

The database migration is additive and replayable. Existing repositories gain
no policies automatically, and their fallback templates are unchanged. Existing
task requests and rows remain valid because all new fields are optional or
empty by default. No runtime feature flag is required because the no-policy path
is unchanged and policies are opt-in.

## Verification strategy

- Repository tests cover persistence, replay, normalization, conflicts,
  authorization, cascade, and atomic Gitflow seeding in SQLite and Postgres.
- Service/runtime tests cover snapshot resolution, stale IDs, raw fallback,
  local fresh branches, title rename, pull-request targets, and agent context.
- Frontend unit tests cover the settings CRUD state, responsive surface choice,
  tagged selector options, local fork transition, and submit payload.
- Desktop and `mobile-chrome` Playwright tests cover collapsed settings, help
  access, Gitflow seeding, policy selection, and visible post-selection state.

The patch repair adds deterministic real-service/SQLite regressions with
independent services and stores, joined context-bound write barriers, both
metadata/workflow orders, a bounded name/template/target mix, omitted versus
blank target defaults, invalid effective-policy rollback, same-field ordering,
and delete/authorization/read-only controls. Registered REST PATCH and WS
dispatch each prove one omitted-field request, response and event against a
real database. Actual task creation proves both new persisted workflow values
and immutable old snapshots. Store tests cover SQLite atomicity and real
PostgreSQL independent physical connections, observed advisory-lock waits,
current-base defaults, row-lock interaction, rollback and uniqueness. PostgreSQL
tests remain environment-gated; an absent DSN is a skip, and hosted evidence must
show the new behavioral test names executed, not merely database boot.

Repair delivery: [Preserve branch-policy workflow edits](../../../plans/branch-policy-patch/plan.md).

Starter admission coverage uses real SQLite independent pools and PostgreSQL
independent physical connections with observed admission waits before predicate
resolution. Competing branch pairs verify typed loser errors and exactly the
winner's four rows. Ordinary-create overlaps verify both legal admission orders,
including five rows when a distinct custom create follows initialization;
different-repository PostgreSQL work must proceed while one key is held.
Registered REST and WS concurrency tests verify winning responses, stored rows,
four events after commit, meaningful loser conflicts and no loser events.
Service tests use real Git fixtures and bounded validation/scope/read-only
controls. Store tests cover cancellation, insert rollback, missing/deleted
parents, uniqueness and successful work after lock release. Tests own deadlines,
cancel/release/join on every path and no production hooks. An absent PG DSN is
a truthful skip requiring hosted execution receipts for the actual new tests.
No rendered UI or mobile interaction changes require browser coverage.
