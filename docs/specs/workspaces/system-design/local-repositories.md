# Local Repository Discovery System Design

## Overview

The workspace system will separate server discovery from desktop discovery.
Server launches retain automatic home discovery. Desktop launches require a
user-selected root before discovery can read the home directory.

This design extends the existing local-repository contract. It does not turn a
discovered repository into a saved repository grant.

## Requirement mapping

| Requirement | Design sections |
| --- | --- |
| REQ-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-001 | Explicit local repository validation, Settings manual validation ownership; existing API, permissions and persistence contract |
| REQ-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-002 | Runtime policy, Desktop folder selection, Home scan exclusions, Persistence and state, Upgrade behavior |
| REQ-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-003 | Discovery flow, User interface, Persistence and state |
| REQ-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-004 | Workspace polling, Diagnostics, Failure handling |

## Goals

- Preserve automatic home discovery for server and web deployments.
- Prevent automatic home scans from an unconfigured desktop application.
- Use a native folder picker for desktop folder selection.
- Return cached repository choices without a filesystem scan.
- Refresh stale data only while a repository-selection surface is visible.
- Explain denied filesystem access through structured diagnostics.
- Stop idle workspace polling after the active operation finishes.

## Non-goals

- Programmatically grant Full Disk Access.
- Guarantee macOS permission persistence for unsigned application updates.
- Give the SPA a generic Tauri filesystem plugin.
- Change provider repository discovery or clone placement.
- Move existing worktrees or scratch workspaces.

## Runtime policy

The Tauri shell sets a dedicated internal desktop marker when it starts the Go
runtime. This process marker selects discovery policy for all connected clients.

The boot payload exposes a desktop picker capability. This client capability
selects the available folder-selection interface. It does not change backend
discovery policy.

| Backend and client | Effective roots | Folder selection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server backend and any browser | Configured roots, otherwise server user Home | HTTP folder browser |
| Desktop backend and Tauri WebView | Configured roots plus selected desktop roots | Native folder picker |
| Desktop backend and ordinary browser | Configured roots plus selected desktop roots | HTTP folder browser |

A desktop backend with no effective root does not scan Home. An ordinary
browser can select a root explicitly, but it does not restore the home fallback.

The desktop marker is internal wiring. It does not become a supported operator
configuration key. If the marker is absent, the backend uses server policy.

## Desktop folder selection

The desktop bridge keeps one origin-checked folder-selection command. The
command opens a native directory panel and returns a selected path,
cancellation, or a failure. It does not block the Tauri IPC worker while the
panel is open. The frontend still waits for the result and disables the picker
trigger to avoid opening a second panel.

The shell checks `Projects`, `Developer`, `src`, `Code`, `workspace`,
`Development`, and `repos` under the desktop user's Home, in that order. It
uses the first existing directory that is not a symlink as the initial panel
location. If none exists, it omits `set_directory` and lets the operating
system choose its default location. The user can navigate to Home from the
panel. This avoids forcing the panel to list Home at open on machines without
a local workspace directory.

The command does not list directories, read files, or accept a caller-provided
path. The Tauri WebView sends the returned path to the desktop root API. The
backend validates the directory before it saves the root.

The same adapter supplies explicit folder selection for repository discovery
and repo-less task folders. The Tauri WebView never calls
`GET /api/v1/fs/list-dir`.

The HTTP directory-listing endpoint remains available in desktop mode. An
ordinary browser can use it because the browser selects paths on the backend
host. Opening that browser is an explicit user action.

Apple documents that a standard open panel grants access to a selected folder
and its descendants for a sandboxed application. Some files can remain
inaccessible for other policy reasons. The implementation must treat selection
as user intent, not as proof that every descendant is readable.

The macOS bundle supplies usage descriptions for Desktop, Documents, and
Downloads access. These descriptions improve dialog text. They do not reduce
dialog frequency or create a stable code identity.

## Home scan exclusions

On macOS, a scan whose canonical root equals the current user Home skips these
direct children:

- `Desktop`
- `Documents`
- `Downloads`.

The walker applies this rule only to direct children of Home. If one protected
folder is an effective root, the walker scans that folder normally.

This rule makes Home discovery useful without three default privacy dialogs. A
user with repositories in a protected folder can select that folder explicitly.

## Persistence and state

The backend stores desktop discovery roots in SQLite as install-wide records.
Each record contains:

- canonical path
- display path relative to home when possible
- state: `connected` or `reconnect_required`
- last successful scan time
- last failure class and time

Operator-configured roots remain in startup configuration. The effective root
set combines configured roots with desktop records. Workspace identifiers do
not change this root set.

The backend seeds the effective set from configured roots on each launch. It
does not copy these roots into SQLite.

The workspace-scoped discovery endpoint returns repositories for one workspace.
It does not give workspace scope to the desktop root records.

The aggregate repository-discovery cache is keyed by the normalized root set
and maximum depth. It stores the last successful repositories, scan time, and
root state. A secondary snapshot cache is keyed by each exact normalized root
and maximum depth. It survives aggregate invalidation so an unchanged root can
retain its last successful repositories while a changed root set is scanned.
One single-flight scan serves concurrent workspace requests for the same key.

## Upgrade behavior

On the first desktop launch after this change, configured roots enter the
effective root set immediately. This path requires no new user selection.

If an existing installation depended on implicit Home, the backend records a
`home_confirmation_required` migration state. It does not create a Home root.

The SQLite migration distinguishes an existing database from a new database.
For an existing database, it records this state only when configured and saved
roots are both empty. A new database starts in the normal unconfigured state.

The UI then shows Continue Home Discovery. This button calls a dedicated
backend confirmation action without opening a picker or sending a path from
the client. The backend checks that desktop Home confirmation is still
pending, resolves its own current user's Home, and adds that canonical path
through the existing discovery-root service. The action returns the saved
root after its first scan. If the pending state is gone and Home is not saved,
the action rejects the stale request; it does not add Home. If Home is already
saved, a repeated request returns that root without starting a second scan.
Saved repositories remain available throughout migration.

This backend action is separate from ordinary folder selection. Sending
`"~"` to `AddDesktopDiscoveryRoot` is invalid: that service treats it as a
literal relative directory name, not as the current user's Home.

## Discovery flow

1. A repository-selection surface requests the current discovery snapshot.
2. The backend returns cached repositories and freshness metadata without a scan.
3. The frontend renders saved and cached repositories immediately.
4. If the surface is active and the snapshot is 30 minutes old, it requests a refresh.
5. The backend shares an existing scan or starts one scan for the root set.
6. Each successful root replaces its cached results, including an empty result.
7. Each failed root retains only its previous results and reports recovery state.

### Partial scan recovery

This section defines AC-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-003.9 through 003.12.
`repoWalker.visit` distinguishes root errors from descendant errors.
An inaccessible root fails its scan. An inaccessible descendant produces a
structured warning and does not terminate traversal of accessible siblings.
Cancellation and deadline expiry abort the operation without a cache write.
The existing Home exclusions and explicit-path validation remain unchanged.

`scanRootForRepos` retains repositories found before a descendant error.
The scan carries the existing runtime and trigger context into descendant
diagnostics. Warnings identify the denied descendant, not just its root.
The walker emits at most one warning per denied path during one scan.
It does not retry denied paths within that scan.

The aggregate `discoveryCacheEntry` retains results by exact normalized scan
root internally. A secondary per-root snapshot retains each root's last
successful result independently of the aggregate root-set key. This preserves
unchanged roots across Add or Reconnect invalidation without borrowing results
from a different normalized path or maximum depth. `scanDiscoveryRoots`
replaces successful root entries and retains failed root entries. A root
without previous results contributes an empty list on failure.
The response deduplicates the union by repository path. Root membership comes
from scan provenance, not a path-prefix guess, because effective roots can overlap.
Cache snapshots and responses copy their slices to prevent concurrent mutation.

The public response keeps its existing fields. `failed_roots` lists current
root failures. Descendant denials do not mark accessible roots as failed.
An absent clone root remains a reported root failure, but never replaces fresh
results from another root. Discovery does not create directories. Failed-root
paths are diagnostic data and are not rendered by repository selectors.

The aggregate `scan_time` advances only after all roots succeed. During partial
failure, it retains the previous complete-scan time, or remains absent.
The coordinator retains automatic-retry suppression for failed snapshots.
Manual Refresh retries the effective roots through the existing single-flight
operation. This repair does not introduce background retries.

The shared discovery coordinator owns one activation count in each browser tab.
An open consumer acquires one activation lease. It releases the lease when the
surface closes or unmounts.

The coordinator starts a stale refresh only when both conditions are true:

- the activation count is more than zero
- `document.visibilityState` is `visible`.

The coordinator does not cancel an active scan when the document becomes
hidden. It starts no new scan until both conditions are true again.

No interval runs when the activation count is zero. A manual Refresh action
bypasses the freshness test but still shares an active scan.

### Shared coordinator response ordering

`RepositoryDiscoveryCoordinator` in
`apps/web/hooks/domains/workspace/use-repository-discovery.ts` implements
AC-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-003.13 within each workspace entry. Cached
snapshot reads and refresh scans retain separate single-flight pending handles,
but share one publication owner. Starting a new transport operation takes
ownership across both kinds. Joining an existing same-kind handle does not
take ownership again for unchanged roots or start a replacement request. Request start
order, rather than completion order or scan timestamps, determines eligibility.

Register ownership and the pending handle before notifying subscribers. Only
the current owner of a still-registered entry can publish a normalized response
or error. A successful empty response is authoritative. A current failure keeps
the last accepted response and publishes its error; an obsolete success cannot
erase that error or supply an unaccepted fallback. Each operation clears only
its own pending handle. Busy state is derived from actual pending work by kind;
refresh state also preserves the accepted response's `refreshing` metadata.
Obsolete cleanup cannot overwrite current data, metadata, or error, and cannot
clear a newer operation's busy state. Settlement must publish coherent state
before subscriber callbacks can start another operation.

Snapshot follow-up freshness work belongs only to an accepted successful
snapshot. Recheck ownership and entry identity after publication, because a
subscriber can synchronously start a newer operation or dispose the coordinator.
Follow-up also requires a visible document and an active lease. Preserve the
existing stale/refreshing decision, failed-root freshness suppression, and
explicit manual recovery. An obsolete snapshot cannot schedule a scan from
shared state; a failed snapshot does not initiate new automatic work.

Releasing the last lease retains the entry and permits an already active
operation to populate its cache, but starts no automatic follow-up. `dispose()`
removes entries and visibility listening. Late settlement from a removed entry
cannot publish, notify, schedule work, or affect a replacement entry with the
same workspace ID. Public `load()` and `refresh()` return the currently
registered entry's accepted response after their joined operation settles, or
`null` when that entry has been removed, without recreating it.

Ordinary `load()` and `refresh()` keep their existing coalescing contract.
Workspace Repositories, root controls, Office, Automations, Create Task, and
Add Workspace Sources share this coordinator. Successful root changes use
the separate synchronization boundary below. No timers, trailing retries,
backend cache keys, cancellation protocol, or store shapes are added.
Desktop and phone reuse their existing presentation and interaction patterns.

### Successful root mutation synchronization

This section implements AC-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-003.14. Desktop root
records and mutation endpoints are install-wide; browser coordinator entries
remain keyed by workspace ID. The guarantee applies to every subscriber and
hook consumer of the initiating workspace entry in this coordinator, not all
entries, browser tabs, or connected clients. Other workspace entries retain
their existing independent reads and normal activation/freshness behavior.
There is no new cross-workspace or backend broadcast mechanism.

Add a narrow `synchronizeAfterRootMutation(workspaceId, kind)` coordinator
method, exposed as `synchronizeAfterRootMutation(kind)` by the discovery hook,
where `kind` is `"load"` or `"refresh"`. Invoke it only after a root mutation's
transport succeeds. In one synchronous boundary, revoke the entry's prior
publication owner, detach both pending handles, and start the chosen new
operation using the existing request machinery. Reserve its new handle and
owner before the first notification; subscriber reentry can then join the
new same-kind operation or start a newer distinct operation under AC-003.13.
Do not notify between invalidation and reserving the fresh operation. Do not
clear the last accepted response optimistically or infer results from paths.

Detached transports still settle and their callers still await them. They
cannot publish responses/errors, clear replacement handles, recreate busy
state, notify consumers as accepted work, or initiate snapshot follow-up.
Ignore settlement that owns neither a current handle nor publication. Current
pending handles and accepted `refreshing` metadata determine busy state;
detached work does not keep a successful new result busy until the old read
returns. Entry identity still fences disposal and same-ID recreation. New
load/refresh await returns retain the registered accepted-response convention.
A later distinct read can take authority normally. A second successful
mutation fences the preceding synchronization as well as ordinary reads.

`useDiscoveryRootActions` requests `"load"` after Add, Home confirmation, and
Reconnect; Remove requests `"refresh"`. Its manual Refresh continues through
ordinary `refresh()` and does not invalidate. Preserve mutation serialization,
Home admission refs, finally cleanup, and existing error reporting. Rejection
or picker cancellation does not invoke this boundary; a current synchronization
failure preserves the accepted response with the current discovery error.
Visibility, leases, freshness, and failed-root policies still govern automatic
follow-up of accepted snapshots.

The settings root-action file is a reexport of this hook. Two direct successful
Add Home call sites also replace their post-action `load()` with this boundary:
`components/task-create-dialog-repo-chips.tsx` and
`components/task/add-workspace-sources/saved-repository-source-row.tsx`.
They keep their existing action and UI admission semantics. No root mutation
client or backend signature changes are required. Backend mutations already
invalidate their discovery cache; the fresh transport reads that authority.

## User interface

Create Task, Add Workspace Sources, Automations, Office project setup, and
Workspace Repositories consume one discovery-state hook.

Desktop with no effective root shows saved repositories and one action named
Choose folders to discover repositories. The action explains that the user can
select Home or a narrower folder.

If migration needs Home confirmation, the surface also shows a direct
Continue Home Discovery button. It has a disabled, busy state while the
backend saves the root and scans. The separate Choose folders action still
opens the picker. On a narrow viewport, both actions remain separate and
reachable in the existing scroll region.

An inaccessible saved root shows Reconnect and Remove actions. Reconnect opens
the native picker again. It does not retry the denied path in the background.

An empty result and a filtered result show a visible Refresh action. This action
lets a user find a repository that arrived before the 30-minute limit.

Phone web with a server backend keeps the server-host repository picker. A
browser on a desktop backend uses desktop policy and the HTTP folder browser.

Temporary repository choices use the current phone-native picker or drawer
composition. No native Tauri control appears in a browser or mobile viewport.

`RepositoryDiscoveryControls` remains the desktop root-management surface. It
does not render failed-root warnings or paths for server, browser, or phone
selectors. Those selectors keep their available repository choices and their
normal manual Refresh action. The backend and coordinator retain failed-root
data for structured diagnostics and automatic-retry suppression, but that data
is logs-only from the selector's perspective.

Saved desktop roots retain their existing Reconnect and Remove actions. Those
controls manage explicit saved roots and do not extend to operator-configured
roots. Phone presentation reuses each existing selector and its scroll owner;
no warning details or extra scroll owner is added. Desktop actions remain 28
pixels high. Phone and coarse-pointer actions have at least 44-pixel hit targets.

## Workspace polling

Repository discovery and workspace monitoring remain separate functions. Normal
worktrees use `~/.kandev/tasks`, which macOS does not protect with folder TCC.

Polling changes reduce CPU use for normal worktrees. They reduce privacy dialogs
only for a direct-local task whose repository is in a protected folder.

Monitoring keeps fast mode for a focused client. It keeps slow mode for an
unfocused agent or terminal operation.

The target modes are:

| State | File monitor | Git status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focused client | 2 seconds | 3 seconds |
| Unfocused operation in flight | 30 seconds | 30 seconds |
| Turn completes without a focused client | One final scan | One final scan |
| No focused client and no operation in flight | Paused | Paused |
| No mode push during the 60-second startup grace | One final scan, then paused | One final scan, then paused |

The lifecycle manager uses the activity lease as the operation signal. The
`releaseActivity(executionActivityKey(...))` seam already identifies turn
completion.

When the last runtime activity ends, the manager requests one final workspace
refresh. Then it removes runtime interest and pushes `paused` unless UI interest
requires `fast` or `slow`.

The aggregator must send a `paused` transition to agentctl. It must not suppress
that transition when it removes the final contribution.

If no mode push arrives during the 60-second startup grace, agentctl performs
one final refresh and enters `paused`. It does not stay in `slow` forever.

An access-denied result pauses the affected tracker. A visible task or explicit
retry action can reactivate it. This rule prevents a denied path from producing
repeated macOS access attempts.

## Diagnostics

Every filesystem operation carries an operation context with these fields:

- operation name
- canonical target path
- trigger, such as `user_select`, `manual_refresh`, `stale_refresh`, or `poll`
- runtime mode
- workspace, task, and session identifiers when available
- poll mode when the operation came from a tracker.

Expected scan starts and skips use `info`. Access denial uses `warn`. Identical
poll warnings use a bounded logger that records the suppressed count. The first
warning must contain enough data to reproduce the operation.

Suggested event names are:

- `repository.discovery.picker_opened`
- `repository.discovery.scan_started`
- `repository.discovery.scan_skipped`
- `filesystem.access_denied`
- `workspace.poll_paused_after_denial`.

## Failure handling

- Picker cancellation changes no grant and starts no scan.
- An invalid selected path is rejected without persistence.
- A partial scan combines fresh successful roots with cached failed roots.
- An inaccessible descendant does not discard accessible sibling results.
- A denied root moves to `reconnect_required` and receives no automatic retry.
- An unsigned update can change macOS code identity. The UI offers Reconnect and
  does not claim that one consent will survive every update.
- An unavailable desktop bridge shows a typed error and does not fall back to
  the server folder browser inside the Tauri WebView.
- An ordinary browser on the desktop backend can use the HTTP folder browser.
- An old implicit-home installation receives a confirmation state. It does not
  receive an automatic Home root.

## Security and privacy

The desktop bridge follows the owned-loopback-origin check used by external
links and native notifications. It returns only a path selected by the user.
No command accepts an arbitrary path or exposes directory contents.

The Tauri permission surface names only the picker command. The implementation
adds `tauri-plugin-dialog` to the `desktop-runtime` feature. It updates
`capabilities/default.json`, generated command permissions, `tauri.conf.json`,
and the bundle usage descriptions. The picker module is exported through
`src/lib.rs` because the binary target has `test = false`.

The HTTP directory-listing API remains part of the trusted local-user model. The
Tauri WebView cannot use it as a fallback.

Diagnostic bundles can contain local paths. Public recovery documentation must
state this before a user exports a bundle.

## Explicit local repository validation

The workspace system canonicalizes an explicit repository path before it is
saved or used. Automatic discovery roots do not constrain explicit selection.

Standalone `.git` directories remain valid when they do not redirect their
common directory. A regular-file `.git` pointer is accepted through one of two
independent reciprocal validators: linked worktrees require `gitdir`,
`commondir`, and placement under `<common>/worktrees`; initialized submodules
require a non-empty `[core] worktree` value in module metadata. Relative values
resolve from the canonical metadata directory and must canonically equal the
selected repository. A `commondir` file excludes the submodule validator. Git
include sections and `extensions.worktreeConfig` are rejected for submodule
metadata because the validator does not evaluate alternate configuration
sources.

When neither validator succeeds, their errors are joined to retain diagnostics.

The explicit repository validation contract is recorded in [Explicit submodule
repository trust](../../../decisions/2026-08-28-explicit-submodule-repository-trust.md).

### Settings manual validation ownership

AC-WORKSPACES-LOCAL-REPOSITORIES-001.9 through 001.11 extend the local
settings draft boundary. `WorkspaceRepositoriesRoute` loads the workspace and
repositories, then renders `WorkspaceRepositoriesClient`. Its exported
`useWorkspaceRepositoriesPage` owns drafts and the nested `useDiscoverDialog`.
`AddLocalRepositoryDialog` forwards that state to the real `DiscoverRepoDialog`:
editable manual input, Validate, discovered selection, Cancel/dismiss and Use
Repository. Desktop root controls retain their existing discovery hooks.

Keep authority local to `useDiscoverDialog`: one mounted lifetime, a dialog
visit/context generation, current workspace ID and trimmed input, and a distinct
attempt token for each admitted validation. Store the requested identity separately
from the response's canonical `path`. A result is usable only for the current
open context and newest attempt. String equality alone cannot recognize a visit
or an A-to-B-to-A transition. Whitespace-only edits preserve the same trimmed
identity; selecting a discovered repository retires manual work.

Open/close, path/selection and confirmation handlers revoke authority synchronously
before publishing React state. Workspace replacement and unmount retire the
committed context before another callback can act; use lifecycle cleanup and
committed latest-context references, with render projection also checking the
current workspace/input/open identity. A passive reset effect alone is insufficient.
An old render must never expose success, error or loading as current while a
reset awaits an effect. StrictMode cleanup/setup must leave a usable new lifetime.

Bind callbacks to their originating context and compare it with current authority
at invocation. A retained validation callback cannot request an old path/workspace
after its context retires. Repeated calls within one unchanged context are allowed:
reserve a new attempt before invoking transport, so synchronous reentry admits
the newest attempt. A retained confirmation must also match its accepted selection
or successful attempt; it cannot admit a retired draft or borrow a newer result.

Use the existing `validateRepositoryPathAction` and `isValidManualRepository`
contract (`exists && is_git`). `useRequest` currently exposes completion-ordered
loading and has no dialog identity. Remove only this hook's reliance on its
unqualified state; call the same action locally and derive `isValidating` from
the owned pending attempt. Do not change the generic hook. Guard success, invalid
response, rejection and finalization with the same context/attempt authority.
Retired transport still settles; preserve the async handler's caught-error/void
settlement for callers. It cannot clear a replacement attempt, revive busy state,
or publish feedback. No cancellation, cache, store or discovery-owner change is
needed.

Project `manualValidation`, `isValidating` and `canSave` from accepted current
state. Confirmation in `useWorkspaceRepositoriesPage` must consult the same local
authority at invocation, rather than trust a button's disabled flag or captured
`manualValidation`. Build a draft only from an actual current discovered row or
accepted canonical manual path in the current workspace. Keep `buildDraftRepo`
defaults and selected repository name/branch behavior. Never substitute raw input
for a stale or missing validated result. Close through the same retirement path.

Confirmation prepends a `temp-repo-*` item only. `handleSaveRepository` later calls
`saveNewRepository` and `createRepositoryAction`; server validation and persistence
remain authoritative. This design changes neither save transport nor draft-store
shape and makes no claim that the observed race already persisted a wrong path.

The same form and state path serve phone and desktop. This is state/data handling
only: no layout, touch, scrolling, navigation, copy or breakpoint changes. Targeted
real form/hook tests satisfy the narrow mobile-parity exception; no new browser,
build or E2E work is required. Verify with the actual exported page hook,
`StateProvider`/`createAppStore`, router, actions, discovery and dialog/root controls,
mocking only fetch transport. Cover identity transitions, retained callbacks,
newest-attempt reentry and ordinary canonical/discovered selection controls.

## Verification strategy

- Go tests cover runtime policy, canonical roots, cache freshness, single-flight
  scans, reconnect state, partial failures, and structured log fields.
- Rust tests cover origin checks, cancellation, directory-only selection, and
  the absence of generic filesystem commands.
- Frontend tests cover all repository-selection consumers through one shared hook.
- Deterministic deferred coordinator tests cover both overlap directions,
  failures, empty results, same-kind sharing, workspace isolation, reentrant
  subscriptions, lease release, and disposal. Real shared-hook/Office-consumer
  integration covers exposed choices and flags with only transport mocked.
- Root-mutation regressions cover each successful action with pending same-kind
  and opposite-kind reads, both settlement orders and failure directions,
  authoritative empty state, fresh pending flags, ordinary sharing, sequential
  mutations, reentry, workspace isolation, release, and disposal. Real discovery
  and root-action hooks plus a real shared Office consumer mock only transport.
- Web E2E uses a stubbed native-picker adapter for selection, cancellation,
  cache, denial, reconnect, removal, and migration states.
- Browser E2E covers server Home discovery at desktop and phone widths. It also
  covers an ordinary browser on a desktop backend.
- Rust tests cover the native command and origin rule through the library target.
- Manual macOS QA covers `NSOpenPanel` and real privacy dialogs.
- Lifecycle tests cover final refresh, paused delivery, startup fallback, focus,
  and new operation activity.
