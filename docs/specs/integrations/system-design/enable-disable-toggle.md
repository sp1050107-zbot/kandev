# Integration Enable/Disable Presentation System Design

## Ownership and mapping

Integrations owns the provider connection and workspace preference used by its
Settings navigation badge. Generic tree composition remains UI-owned.

| Requirement | Design boundary |
| --- | --- |
| REQ-INTEGRATIONS-ENABLE-DISABLE-TOGGLE-001 | Workspace preferences, navigation and badge projection |

## Workspace preferences and navigation

`useIntegrationEnabled` and `useIntegrationEnabledReader` own the existing
per-workspace localStorage preference, legacy migration and storage/custom-event
subscriptions. `INTEGRATION_ENABLED_KEYS` and `INTEGRATION_ENABLED_SYNC_EVENTS`
are the shared identity catalog. No keys or persistence rules change.

The index and provider settings controls use `useDraftedIntegrationEnabled`
with the Settings save coordinator. Navigation consumes saved preferences;
drafts remain local until Save. `useSettingsMenuBranches` continues controlling
row visibility through the hide-disabled preference. Badge eligibility is a
separate projection and never removes a row itself.

## Badge projection

`useEnabledIntegrations(workspaceId)` combines each built-in provider's existing
connection predicate with `readEnabled(INTEGRATION_ENABLED_KEYS[slug], workspaceId)`
from a subscribed `useIntegrationEnabledReader`. Its memo depends on that reader
as well as connection signals, so saving a toggle or a storage event recomputes
the eligible slug set. Keep the exhaustive `Record<IntegrationSlug, boolean>`.

GitLab connection status must be read with `useGitLabStatus(workspaceId)`;
`useGitLabAvailable()` implicitly reads the active workspace and cannot identify
a different workspace's tree row. GitHub already accepts an explicit workspace.
Azure DevOps, Jira, Linear and Sentry keep their existing connection predicates.
GitHub and GitLab continue accepting authenticated OR token-configured status.
This changes badge projection only, without gating provider operations.

`IntegrationsEnabledProvider` shares one eligible set per workspace branch.
`IntegrationEnabledBadgeFor` renders the existing localized badge from this set.
Plugin badges retain the registry's workspace-scoped enabled map and subscription.
Clarify source comments that currently equate connection with enablement.

## Failure, persistence and responsive behavior

Unresolved or unavailable connection status produces no badge. Existing storage
fallbacks and migration rules remain intact. Saving toggles introduces no backend
write, health mutation, metric or request beyond existing connection reads.

The desktop Settings sidebar and phone `/settings` index consume this
projection through the same `SettingsTree`. The phone index mounts
`SettingsPageNav`, which presents the tree as touch rows while the desktop
sidebar is hidden. Both surfaces remove or restore the same Enabled badge.
Layout, hit targets, scroll ownership and route composition remain unchanged.

## Validation

Hook tests cover all six built-ins, connected-but-disabled status, re-enabling,
same-tab and cross-tab events, unsaved drafts and explicit workspace isolation.
A focused rendered badge test uses the real projection with mocked connection
probes. The integrations toggle Playwright suite checks saved GitHub/GitLab
disable/re-enable against the desktop tree. `mobile-settings-index.spec.ts`
checks the phone tree with saved toggles on, off and on again, retaining
reachable rows when disabled. Capture that visible phone index for PR evidence.
