# Interactive Read Availability System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

Platform owns operational read availability. Analytics owns aggregate execution,
while workspace recovery follows its
[workspace design](../../workspaces/system-design/workspace-read-recovery.md).
The existing [required-store design](postgres-domain-store-parity.md#runtime-health)
and [persistence ADR](../../../decisions/2026-09-05-required-internal-persistence.md)
remain authoritative. This design adds workload control, not a health bypass.

## Query shape and metric compatibility

Change `internal/analytics/repository/sqlite/stats.go`. All runtime reads use
`Repository.ro`. The database layer supplies the selected SQLite or PostgreSQL
handle; continue using `dialect` helpers, `sqlx.In`, and `Rebind`.

For `GetTaskStats`, select the eligible workspace task page first, using the
existing task-created range, updated-time ordering, and caller's limit including
the extra pagination row. Aggregate sessions, turns, and messages independently
for those task IDs, then join aggregates. Session-start filtering remains distinct
from task-created filtering. Do not add a message timestamp filter where none
exists. Empty sessions still contribute a session count; messages without a turn
still contribute message counts. Preserve last completion, elapsed span, active
duration, and zero values. Add a task-ID tie-break only if existing tests/contracts
permit it; this repair does not require changing tied-row ordering.

For `GetRepositoryStats` and `buildRepositoryStatsQuery`, select eligible workspace
repositories before their child aggregates. Preserve the current distinctions:
task counts follow task-created range; session counts/messages/duration follow
session-start range; commit totals follow committed-at range. Task/session totals
are attributed through `task_repositories`; git totals use the session repository.
A task attached to two repositories contributes once to each eligible repository.
Do not sum raw turns after joining raw messages. Exclude soft-deleted repositories,
ephemeral tasks, and automation tasks as before.

For `GetDailyActivity`, constrain turn days to the requested inclusive UTC date
series before grouping. Count turns/tasks by day independently. Count messages
through distinct eligible (session, day) pairs, preserving current behavior: a
message contributes only when that session has a turn on the same day. Do not
silently redefine this as all messages created that day. Use portable timestamp
bounds/dialect normalization and cover midnight boundaries and naive UTC columns.
The date series still emits zero buckets. All-time heatmap remains 365 days.

`GetGlobalStats` already separates major aggregates. Preserve its clean-turn
outlier calculation. Keep completed activity, model usage, git totals, DTOs, top
model limits, completion definitions, and authorization unchanged. Add an index
only when query-plan evidence shows an unmet access path; replay it through the
existing `ensureStatsIndexes`, without a speculative index inventory.

## Admission and cancellation

Use one context-aware admission gate owned by the shared analytics repository
instance. Acquire once at each of its eight public read methods, including
`ListSessionCodeStats`; release after all rows close or any error. Do not acquire
again inside query helpers. Both HTTP Stats and plugin Host data reads receive the
same repository from `backendapp/storage.go`, so they share this budget.

Allow at most two concurrent analytics operations. The default SQLite pool has
four reader connections; queued analytics must not borrow another connection.
Keep the same analytics cap for PostgreSQL to avoid driver-specific request
behavior. It does not promise reserved capacity against unrelated workloads.
No new pool, broad scheduler, configurable knob, or persistent cache is needed.

Each operation has a ten-second total queue-plus-query deadline, capped by the
caller's earlier deadline. Waiting uses context cancellation. Check cancellation
again after admission and before SQL. Context-aware query/scan cleanup must return
capacity on cancellation, errors, and panic-safe deferred cleanup. Plugin calls
retain existing service error translation; no new plugin wire contract is added.

The Stats HTTP handler maps its own admission/query deadline to HTTP 503 with
`error_code: "analytics_busy"`, a sanitized message, and `Retry-After: 2`.
Client cancellation is not reported as a database defect. Other database errors
retain the existing error handling. Authorize before exposing analytics status.
Use `ApiError.errorCode` for the new error; persistence middleware instead uses
`body.code: "persistence_unavailable"`, so client classification must inspect that
existing field without changing the middleware contract.

The cap protects capacity; query optimization makes it practical. Never ship
serialization as the only performance fix. Tests hold admitted work at barriers,
then prove a normal read and a real health probe complete through the shared pool.

## Section recovery and presentation

`apps/web/app/stats/stats-data.tsx` retains independently loaded sections and adds
retry state/actions. Preserve its AbortController and workspace/range generation.
Keep successful section data during same-selection retries. A selection change
resets all sections and aborts every old timer/request. Copy remains gated by
`composeStatsResponse`.

Retry failed transient sections only: network failures, HTTP 429/502/503/504.
Allow two scheduled retries at 2 and 5 seconds after each preceding failure,
honoring a larger Retry-After. Cancel automatic retries while hidden; use
`useForegroundRefresh` to start one bounded recovery cycle on return. Manual
Retry starts a bounded cycle immediately. Timer, foreground, and manual triggers
coalesce into one in-flight request per section. No automatic retry for auth,
404, parse, or cancellation errors. Test using fake timers and deferred responses.

Render an inline failure and Retry in affected section cards using the existing
stats components. A same-selection refresh with retained data labels it stale;
an initial failure displays no fabricated zero. Show retry-in-progress status and
disable duplicate actions. Map temporary availability errors to translated copy
rather than exposing raw backend text. Update all five locale catalogs and generate
the Traditional Chinese pair using the repository script.

Desktop keeps its multi-column Stats layout. Phone enters through the existing
hamburger Stats destination and uses the existing single-column cards. Retry is
inside the failed card with at least a 44px touch area; ordinary desktop sizing
remains 28px. Keep the page's existing scroll owner, safe areas, focus behavior,
and no horizontal overflow. Workspace navigation remains its existing drawer.

## Performance evidence

Seed disposable data: 700 eligible tasks, 800 sessions, 5,000 turns, 650,000
messages, 2,200 commits, and five repositories in the measured workspace. Add a
second equally sized workspace to detect unnecessary cross-workspace scans.
Concentrate at least 200 turns and 10,000 messages in one session. Spread the
history over 400 days, including empty sessions and days without turns.

Use the same SQLite file shape, indexes, machine, and non-race binary before and
after optimization. Record CPU, memory, filesystem, driver, query plans, per-endpoint
latency, admission wait, and all-seven completion latency. Run ten measured warm
cycles after one warmup, for week/month/all ranges. The five-second p95 target
applies on a machine with at least four available CPU cores, 8 GiB RAM, and local
SSD storage, without unrelated load. Record cold results separately, without
claiming warm targets for cold caches. Also record a minimum fivefold improvement
for the heavy-join fixture; this is a delivery benchmark, not a fragile CI timer.

Normal tests assert numeric equivalence and concurrency bounds. Add opt-in Go
benchmarks with deterministic fixtures and report results in the work order.
Do not copy the user's database or transcripts into fixtures. A benchmark that
misses the target requires query work before the work order is done.

## Persistence and diagnostics

No new schema is required unless a measured index is necessary. Retain dual-engine
conformance. Actual missing tables and closed pools must still fail health and
recover through the existing probe rules. Do not increase health timeouts or
reader counts to hide overload. Pool exhaustion caused by other subsystems remains
outside this repair and must not be reported as solved.

Record bounded analytics operation names and elapsed admission/execution time in
existing structured logs on slow or failed calls. Do not log SQL, task titles,
workspace data, credentials, or query payloads. Request timings and health logs
provide the integration evidence; diagnostic bundles remain the collection path.

## Clarification workload control

The task repository owns one admission gate for `ListUnresolvedClarificationBundles`
and `CountHiddenClarificationBundles`. Permit one operation at a time, across
workspaces and HTTP/MCP callers sharing that repository. Acquire before SQL,
release after rows close, and bound queue plus execution to ten seconds.
Use the caller's earlier deadline when present. Check cancellation after
admission before starting SQL. Match the existing analytics admission pattern;
do not introduce a generic database scheduler or additional pool.

The normal and hidden HTTP inbox handlers also impose a ten-second total read
deadline. Carry it through authorization, listing, message hydration, and counts.
Translate an internally expired read into sanitized HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 2`.
Preserve authorization and non-timeout database error handling. Caller cancellation
must release capacity without changing required-store health. MCP keeps its
existing error envelope, and mutating clarification responses keep their current
ownership and transaction path.

Measure the list and hidden-count query plans before changing SQL or indexes.
`clarificationBundleTableExpr` currently groups message history before applying
workspace conditions. Inspect its access paths on substantial unrelated history.
Push eligible task/session restrictions into candidate selection where semantics
permit, or add a measured dialect-safe index through existing schema replay.
Keep the common predicate shared by listing and counts. Preserve mixed-status
bundles, parent-question exclusion, current-turn authority, nested question IDs,
sidecars, and cursor ordering. Do not copy a live database into a fixture.

The admission test holds the admitted query at a barrier. Excess work must wait
without borrowing connections. A task read and real `requiredstores.Health.Check`
must succeed through the same factory-created SQLite pool. Test cancellation,
SQL failures, missing tables, and recovery separately. PostgreSQL retains the
same operation cap and equivalent query results.

`useNeedsYouInboxController` owns one refresh coordinator for all five existing
trigger families. Coalesce mount, reconnect, foreground, periodic, snooze, and
WS refresh requests into one in-flight read for the active scope. Events during
execution set one dirty marker; a trailing read refreshes the latest state.
Use a one-second minimum between background request starts. A failed temporary
read imposes a shared cooldown of 2, 5, 15, then 30 seconds, capped at 30 seconds.
Honor a longer Retry-After. Events cannot reset the failure count or shorten it.
The cooldown itself does not create an endless timer: a pending trigger can
produce one deferred read. Retain the existing visible-only periodic trigger.

Abort outstanding reads and clear pending work when workspace, identity, feature
activation, or component lifetime changes. Keep generation guards as a second
defense against late results. Auth and permanent lookup failures suspend automatic
refresh until the scope changes; explicit user recovery remains available.
Preserve the Inbox's existing rule that failed reads clear its rows and badge.
This repair adds no speculative counts or new badge presentation.

Log slow or failed clarification operations with fixed operation names, admission
wait, execution time, and reader pool statistics. Avoid row data, metadata, SQL,
credentials, and transcripts. Before claiming the live incident solved, correlate
query ownership with a health-probe timeout or reproduce it on disposable data.
One occupied inbox slot does not reserve capacity against other subsystems.

## Task navigation recovery

`TaskNavigationReads` remains the owner of shared task/session identity reads.
Retain its navigation-generation and authentication/workspace scope checks.
Add cancellation transport to `fetchTaskNavigationIdentity`, passing the request
signal through both existing API calls. Obsolete generations cannot publish or
start a retry. Shared consumers must not independently abort each other's read;
the navigation owner controls cancellation at scope changes.

Use one recovery owner for the selected navigation identity. Route hydration and
`useTaskDetails` consume its attempt state and retry action. Do not add independent
route and component retry loops. Failed session-list enrichment keeps its existing
fallback behavior and can retry separately without discarding successful task
details. Do not infer that an empty fallback session list is authoritative.

Classify network failures and HTTP 429/502/503/504 as temporary. Recognize the
existing persistence code through `ApiError.body.code`; `ApiError.errorCode`
currently exposes only `error_code`. Do not change server envelopes or retry
parse errors, aborts, authorization errors, or 404. A recovery cycle permits two
scheduled retries after 2 and 5 seconds, honoring a larger Retry-After. Each read
attempt has a ten-second deadline; expiry aborts its task and session requests
and is classified as a temporary failure within that retry budget. Navigation
cancellation remains an abort and does not retry. Hidden tabs suspend scheduled
retry work. Manual Retry starts a new bounded cycle. Foreground recovery
coalesces with active recovery and starts at most one cycle per foreground
episode. Ordinary rerenders and WS notifications cannot restart an exhausted
cycle.

When no task details exist, render a temporary read-error surface with Retry and
the existing task-overview link. Keep permanent failures in `TaskLoadErrorState`.
For a failed same-task refresh, retain authorized loaded content and show a small
in-flow availability notice with Retry. Existing cache invalidation still clears
data when authorization or workspace scope changes.

Desktop enters through the sidebar; phone enters through existing task navigation
or a direct route. Reuse the missing-task recovery surface and `task-layout.tsx`
as composition precedents. Both layouts use the same classification and recovery
state. Show status, explanation, primary Retry, then the overview link.
Phone stacks actions inside the main content area, retains the route's scroll
owner and safe-area handling, and provides targets of at least 44px. Desktop uses
ordinary 28px buttons. Use semantic status announcements and retain focus on the
Retry control during attempts. No overlay or automatic page reload is needed.

Add copy in all seven locale catalogs, generating the Traditional Chinese pair
with `i18n:zh-hant`. Test temporary failure followed by success, exhausted retries,
manual recovery, valid selected-session preservation, and navigation during an
old pending retry. Cover permanent 404 behavior separately.
