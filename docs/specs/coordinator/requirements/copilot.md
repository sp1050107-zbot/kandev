# Coordinator copilot and tool surface Requirements

## Overview

A manager talks to a coordinator through a chat panel on the right side of
the Coordinator screens, laid out like the board's task preview panel. The conversation is an ordinary Kandev session on an ephemeral task.
Phase 1 is attended: only a manager's message starts a turn. The coordinator's
Kandev tools can read the workspace and propose tasks, and nothing else.

How the panel shows the coordinator's work is in
[copilot activity display](copilot-activity.md).

Kandev enforces the coordinator's Kandev surface. It does not control the agent
CLI's own tools (a shell on its executor, its own MCP servers, its own
permission settings); in phase 1 a coordinator is as capable through those as
any Kandev chat on the same profile, and no more.

## Terminology

- **Conversation task:** the ephemeral task with origin `coordinator` that
  holds one coordinator's conversation.
- **Turn:** one agent run in response to one message.
- **Coordinator surface:** the set of Kandev MCP tools registered for a
  conversation task's session.
- Other terms are defined in the [system README](../README.md#terms).

## Mockup

The phase 1 mockup screenshots are the visual reference for this document's
user-facing criteria; each requirement below cites the ones it covers. Where
a screenshot and an acceptance criterion differ, the criterion governs. The
prototype banner, the demo controls and the `P1` and `WC-` labels are mockup
chrome, not product; the data is seeded fiction.

The mockup draws the copilot as a floating popover. The copilot is a
right-side panel instead (PR #3981), so
the screenshots are the reference for the copilot's content (header,
transcript, context chip, composer and proposal card), not for its frame, size
or position; [REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004](#req-coordinator-copilot-004-copilot-panel)
governs those.

## Requirements

### REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001: Conversation

**Intent:** Each coordinator keeps one persistent conversation.

**User story:** As a workspace manager, I want to ask the coordinator why
something needs me, so that I can decide without reading the board.

Mockup:

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png): a conversation in the panel: the user message with its about tag and a Kandev read tool call.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.1:** When a manager opens a coordinator's
  conversation for the first time, the system shall create one ephemeral
  conversation task with origin `coordinator`, using the coordinator's agent
  profile and executor, and return its `task_id`, `session_id` and archive
  state.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.2:** When the conversation is opened again and
  its session has not ended (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.10`), the system shall
  return the same task; when two opens race, both shall return the same task
  and exactly one conversation task shall exist.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.3:** When the conversation task no longer exists,
  the next open shall create a new one.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.4:** When a conversation starts, the agent shall
  receive the coordinator's standing instructions: its job, the workspace, its
  context text and that every write is a proposal. After a saved context
  change, the next open shall return a new conversation task carrying the new
  context; the previous conversation task shall be archived, is never returned
  by an open again, and is deleted with the coordinator or the workspace.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.5:** The conversation task shall never appear on a
  board, in a task list, in Needs you or Queue, or as a Quick Chat tab.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.6:** When a coordinator is deleted, its current
  conversation task and its archived conversation tasks shall be deleted.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.7:** An open shall return a conversation task
  whose session exists and has no agent running unless a manager's message
  started one; the open itself shall never start an agent.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.8:** A conversation task shall not be removed by
  Quick Chat idle expiry, however long it stays idle.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.9:** When an open loses the race described in
  `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.2` and finds no other task to converge on
  because a context or profile change cleared the reference concurrently, the
  open shall return 409; the panel's next open retries with the fresh
  value. The same applies when a context or profile change archives the task
  an open is about to return, whether that task was reused or just created,
  between the open reading it as current and the open's own response: the
  open shall return 409 rather than a task that is actually archived.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.11:** When a context or profile change is saved
  while an open is creating a conversation task, the open shall not attach a
  task created under the earlier configuration: it shall delete that task and
  return 409, even when the conversation reference is empty both before and
  after the change.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.10:** When the current conversation task's
  session is `FAILED`, `CANCELLED` or `COMPLETED` (it has ended and can take no
  further message), the next open shall archive that task and return a new
  conversation task with a new session, created as in
  `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.1` and starting no agent
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.7`). The archived task is never returned by an
  open again, its transcript is not shown by the copilot, and it is deleted
  with the coordinator or the workspace. When two opens race over the same
  ended task, both shall return the same new task and exactly one new
  conversation task shall exist.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002: Attended turns

**Intent:** Nothing but a manager's message makes the coordinator act.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.1:** The only way to start a coordinator turn
  shall be a message a manager sends to its conversation task.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.2:** Opening, closing or reloading the copilot,
  creating the conversation, a stall event, a workspace deletion event, a
  proposal decision, startup recovery and session recovery after a restart
  shall not send a message to, resume or start the conversation session.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.3:** When a reader sends a message to a
  conversation task, the system shall refuse it and start nothing.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.4:** After a reload, the launcher shall show
  the session's current state, and when the panel is opened the transcript
  shall reappear with that state: a turn still running shows as running, an
  idle session shows as idle. The
  reload shall send no resume or restore request; an idle agent starts again
  only when the manager sends a message. While the panel is closed, the
  launcher's state shall come from reads that create nothing, never from an
  open: when the coordinator has no current conversation task, or its state
  cannot be read, the launcher shows idle.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003: Kandev tool surface

**Intent:** Through Kandev, a coordinator can only read and propose.

Mockup:

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png): the coordinator's one write, a task proposal pending approval.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.1:** In phase 1, a coordinator session shall
  have exactly these seven Kandev tools, the phase-1 tool profile:
  `list_tasks_kandev`, `get_task_conversation_kandev`,
  `list_workflows_kandev`, `list_workflow_steps_kandev`,
  `list_repositories_kandev`, `get_coordinator_item_kandev` and
  `propose_task_kandev`. It shall have no other
  Kandev tool, including no `list_related_tasks_kandev`, no plan read, no
  user-question tool, no task-title tool and no plugin tool. The profile is
  phase 1's hardcoded policy, not a permanent contract: a later phase may give
  a coordinator more tools, only through the coordinator permission model
  recorded as out of scope in [coordinators](coordinators.md#out-of-scope).
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.2:** When a coordinator session calls any other
  Kandev tool or action, the system shall refuse it with an error naming the
  tool and change nothing.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.3:** When a coordinator session names a
  workspace other than its coordinator's (including a `workspace_id` argument
  of `list_workflows_kandev` or `list_repositories_kandev`), or a task,
  workflow, step or repository of another workspace, the system shall refuse
  the call and return nothing from that workspace.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.4:** When a session that is not a coordinator
  session sends the proposal action, the system shall refuse it.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.5:** A session is a coordinator session only when
  its task has origin `coordinator` and is the named coordinator's current
  conversation task; task creation through HTTP or MCP shall not be able to set
  origin `coordinator`.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.6:** When a coordinator session would start while
  the flag is off, its coordinator does not exist, its task cannot be read, its
  agent profile is missing or CLI-passthrough, or its executor profile is
  missing, the session shall not start and the
  system shall report an error; it shall never start with the regular task
  tools.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.7:** In a coordinator session, Kandev shall
  auto-approve permission requests only for the exact tools of
  `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.1`, and shall not auto-approve any other tool of
  any MCP server named `kandev`.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.8:** A coordinator session shall ignore the agent
  profile's auto-approve setting and any agentctl auto-approve environment
  setting, on first launch, on a re-created or resumed execution and on a
  workspace-only execution that is later promoted.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.9:** Permission requests the agent raises for its
  own tools shall appear in the copilot with Approve and Deny, as in any Kandev
  chat.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004: Copilot panel

**Intent:** The manager asks beside the list, the way a board card is
previewed beside the board.

Mockup:

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png): the copilot's header, transcript and composer over Needs you (drawn as a popover; the panel frame is set by the criteria below).

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.1:** On the Coordinator screens, managers shall
  see a launcher at the bottom right while the panel is closed. It opens a
  panel on the right side of the content area, the full height of the content
  area, titled "Coordinator: <name>" with Close and no Expand or maximize
  action. While the panel is open the launcher is hidden. Readers shall see no
  launcher and shall have no way to open the panel.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.2:** While the conversation's agent is running,
  the launcher shall show a busy state when the panel is closed, and the panel
  header shall show a busy state when it is open.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.3:** The panel shall show the transcript and a
  composer without a mode or model selector.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.4:** When the conversation is empty, the panel
  shall show "Ask why something is on the list. I read the same facts the list
  is derived from. Through Kandev I can only propose a task, and it waits for
  your decision." and one "Try asking" suggestion that fills the composer without
  sending.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.5:** When a turn is running and the panel
  closes, the turn shall continue and the launcher shall show it is busy; the
  composer's Stop shall end the turn.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.6:** While the copilot shows a session that is
  `FAILED`, `CANCELLED` or `COMPLETED` (including an agent that failed to
  start after the manager's message), the copilot shall show Kandev's session
  recovery feedback above the transcript, carrying the session's error
  message when it has one, and the lists shall keep working. Choosing the
  feedback's Retry shall open the conversation again, which returns a new
  conversation (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.10`); the copilot then shows that
  new, empty conversation without the feedback. Retry starts no agent and
  sends no message. This state is the copilot's own; the task page, mobile and
  Settings chat recovery are unchanged.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.7:** Escape pressed while focus is inside the
  panel shall close the panel and return focus to the launcher. When the panel
  floats (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.8`), a click on the backdrop shall also
  close it and return focus to the launcher.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.8:** The panel shall lay out as the board's
  task preview panel does. When the list keeps at least half of the content
  area's width beside the panel, the panel sits beside the list and the list
  narrows to the remaining width, so the panel covers no part of the list;
  otherwise the panel floats over the list from the right edge above a
  backdrop, and the list keeps its width. At a 1440px-wide viewport with the
  sidebar expanded and the default panel width, the panel sits beside the list
  and covers no item action. At the mobile breakpoint (390px included) the
  panel fills the screen width and height with no resize handle and no
  horizontal scroll.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.9:** Configuration chat on `/settings` shall
  behave as before, Expand included.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.10:** While a turn is running, the composer
  shall not send a message; it offers Stop instead.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.11:** Outside the mobile breakpoint, dragging
  the panel's left edge shall resize it. The first opening in a browser uses
  500px; the width shall never be narrower than 320px (380px at a coarse
  pointer) nor wider than 95% of the viewport width. The chosen width shall
  persist in that browser across reloads and coordinators, separately from the
  board preview panel's width.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.12:** The panel, its chip and its composer draft
  shall stay as they are when the manager switches between the same
  coordinator's Needs you and Queue. Leaving that coordinator's screens (to
  another coordinator or any other page) shall close the panel and clear the
  chip and the draft. Closing the panel (Close, Escape or the backdrop) and
  opening it again on the same coordinator's screens shall keep the chip and
  the draft. A reload shall leave the panel closed with no chip and no draft.
  An undecodable workspace or coordinator path component shall count as
  leaving those screens: it shall clear the slot without a copilot reset
  error. Valid encoded identities shall retain their exact once-decoded
  value, including a literal percent or encoded slash. Only Needs you and
  its optional Queue suffix, each with an optional trailing slash, retain
  the slot; the generic coordinator page and unsupported suffixes clear it.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.13:** The board's task preview panel shall
  behave as before: the same layout rule, resize bounds, persisted width,
  Escape and backdrop close, and maximize action.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005: Ask about this

**Intent:** A question starts from the item it is about.

Mockup:

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png): Ask about this: the chip, the drafted question and the stored-form hint.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.1:** When a manager chooses **Ask about this** on
  an item, the panel shall open with a removable context chip naming the item
  and "Why is <id> here?" in the composer, focused and not sent; `<id>` is the
  card identifier, or the proposal title for a proposal without a source task.
  The chip shall also carry the item's stable reference: its kind (`task`,
  `proposal` or `stall`) and its id.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.2:** While the chip is set, each message sent
  shall be stored with the prefix "About <id> [<kind>:<ref>]: ", where
  `<ref>` is the proposal id for a proposal and the task id otherwise, and the
  composer shall show `your message is sent as "About <id>: ..."`.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.3:** In the coordinator's transcript, a message
  beginning "About <id> [<kind>:<ref>]: " (or the reference-less
  "About <id>: " of earlier messages) shall render as the text without the
  prefix plus an "about <id>" tag; the stored message shall keep the prefix.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.6:** When a coordinator session calls
  `get_coordinator_item_kandev` with a `proposal` reference, it shall receive
  that proposal of its own coordinator (spec, status, error and timestamps);
  with a `stall` reference, the stall record of that task in its workspace.
  A reference to another coordinator's proposal or another workspace's task
  shall be refused like any foreign id (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.3`), as
  shall a missing proposal; a task of its workspace with no stall record
  is not found; another `kind` (even `task`) or empty id is refused, naming
  it.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.4:** When the chip is removed, the next message
  shall be sent without a prefix.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-005.5:** Choosing **Ask about this** on another item
  shall replace the chip and replace the composer text with that item's
  question.

## Out of scope

- The launcher on other pages, the settings header switch, Expand and a Quick
  Chat tab of kind `coordinator` (phase 2, decision D11).
- Context ids on the wire (phase 2, decision D12); phase 1 sends text only.
- Waking the coordinator on events, schedules or backstops (phase 3, gate G3).
- Enforced containment of the agent CLI's own tools: a gate G3 condition before
  any unattended turn. Phase 1 states the residual instead.
- `ask_user_question` for coordinators: coordinators ask through proposals.
- Showing an ended conversation's transcript after a new one replaces it
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.10`): the archived task keeps its messages but
  no surface lists or opens it. A "past conversations" view needs a read route
  over archived conversation tasks.
- Resuming or restarting an ended coordinator session in place: Kandev
  rejects messages to a terminal session, and the copilot's recovery is a new
  conversation, never a resume (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.2`).
- Coordinator-specific recovery copy: the copilot reuses Kandev's session
  recovery feedback and its existing translated copy.
