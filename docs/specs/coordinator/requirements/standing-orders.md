# Standing orders Requirements

## Overview

A standing order is a dated rule a manager gives a coordinator, such as
"Prefer small cards" or "Never propose work on the release board on
Fridays". Orders are given to the coordinator when a conversation starts.
Changing them starts the next conversation fresh. Orders are guidance only:
they grant nothing, and the May do settings still decide what can run. A
rejection reason can become an order in one step.

## Terminology

- **Active order:** a standing order that is not retired.
- **Order number:** the 1-based position of an active order when the active
  orders are sorted by `created_at` ascending, then `id` ascending.
- Other terms are defined in the [system README](../README.md#terms) and
  [permissions](permissions.md#terminology).

## Mockup

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator-p2/assets/p2-02-settings-coordinator-sections.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator-p2/assets/p2-02-settings-coordinator-sections.png): the Sections row with Standing orders and its help text.

## Requirements

### REQ-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001: Adding and retiring orders

**Intent:** A manager keeps a short list of rules the coordinator follows.

**User story:** As a workspace manager, I want to give my coordinator
standing rules, so that I do not repeat them in every conversation.

Mockup:

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator-p2/assets/p2-02-settings-coordinator-sections.png`](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator-p2/assets/p2-02-settings-coordinator-sections.png): the Standing orders tab.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.1:** When a manager adds a standing
  order whose text, after trimming, is 1 to 500 Unicode code points, the system shall
  store it with a new id, the trimmed text, `created_at` and the manager's
  user id, and return it. Other text shall be refused with 400 naming
  `text`.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.2:** When a coordinator already has 20
  active orders, the system shall refuse an add, or a restore of a retired
  order, with 400 and the code `standing_order_limit`; restoring an order
  that is already active shall return it as `AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.3`
  says, whatever the count. Concurrent adds shall never leave more than 20
  active.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.3:** When a manager retires an active
  order, the system shall set its `retired_at` and `retired_by` and keep the
  row. When a manager restores a retired order, the system shall clear both.
  Retiring a retired order or restoring an active one shall return the order
  unchanged with 200.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.4:** The Standing orders section shall
  list the active orders in order-number order, each showing "Standing order
  N", its text, "Added <date>", its last-applied text
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003.3`) and **Retire this order**, with
  **Add standing order** below the list. With no active order it shall say
  that there are no standing orders yet.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.5:** When a manager retires an order, a
  toast shall say it was retired and offer **Undo** for 10 seconds; Undo shall
  restore it.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.6:** A reader shall see the list without
  Add, Retire or Undo; a reader's add, retire or restore request shall be
  refused with 403 and change nothing.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.7:** An order's text cannot be edited;
  to change a rule, a manager retires it and adds a new one.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-002: Given when a conversation starts

**Intent:** Orders reach the coordinator without depending on it to look.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-002.1:** When a coordinator conversation
  opens, its standing instructions shall include every active order in
  order-number order, each with its number, its text and its added date,
  introduced as rules from the workspace's managers that never grant a
  permission. With no active order, the instructions shall have no
  standing-orders section.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-002.2:** When a manager adds, retires or
  restores an order, the system shall archive the coordinator's current
  conversation task and clear its reference, so the next conversation starts
  with the new list. A retire or restore that changes nothing shall keep the
  conversation.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-002.3:** An order shall grant no permission:
  an action the coordinator attempts because of an order is decided by its
  May do settings and the guard alone.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003: Shaped by, and last applied

**Intent:** A manager sees which rule shaped a proposal.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003.1:** Every propose tool shall accept an
  optional `standing_order_ids` list of at most 5 ids. When any id is not an
  active order of the calling coordinator, or the list is longer than 5 or
  repeats an id, the system shall refuse the call naming
  `standing_order_ids`. Accepted ids shall be stored on the proposal.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003.2:** A proposal card with cited orders
  shall show "Shaped by: Standing order N" for each order that is still
  active, and "Shaped by: a retired standing order" for each that is not; the
  order's text shall be available from the label.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003.3:** Each active order shall show "Last
  applied <relative time>", from the most recent `created_at` of the
  coordinator's proposals that cite it, or "Never applied" when none does.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-003.4:** Shaped by labels shall follow the
  order of the proposal's `standing_order_ids`; while the orders are loading
  or when their read failed, the card shall show no Shaped by label and shall
  still allow every action; an id no order matches shall show no label; and
  each label's order text shall be reachable by hover, keyboard focus and
  tap.

### REQ-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-004: Make it a standing order

**Intent:** A manager turns a reason for rejecting into a lasting rule.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-004.1:** When a manager rejects a proposal
  with a non-empty reason while the phase-2 flag is on, a toast shall say
  "Rejected. Keep the reason as a standing order?" with **Make it a standing
  order** for 10 seconds. A rejection without a reason shall show no offer.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-004.2:** When the manager chooses **Make it
  a standing order**, an add dialog shall open with the reason as editable
  text; saving shall add the order as in
  `AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-001.1` with `source_proposal_id` set to the
  rejected proposal, and cancelling shall add nothing.
- **AC-COORDINATOR-STANDING-ORDERS-004.3:** A reason that is empty after
  trimming shall show no offer. The dialog shall prefill the trimmed reason
  cut to 500 code points, shall stay open when its toast expires, and on a
  successful save shall close and show "Standing order added." and leave the
  Configure list to refetch on its next load. While the save is in flight Save
  shall be disabled so a second activation posts nothing, and a failed save
  shall keep the dialog open with the reason text and show an inline error.

## Out of scope

- Editing an order's text in place.
- Orders shared by several coordinators or set for a whole workspace.
- The coordinator suggesting its own orders (phase 3 improvement proposals).
- Checking whether the coordinator followed an order; last applied counts
  only the orders its proposals cite.
