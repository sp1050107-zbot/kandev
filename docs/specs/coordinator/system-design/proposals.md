# Task proposals System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

Proposals are the coordinator's only write. The proposal service stores them,
validates them against the workspace, and on approval creates one ordinary
task through the task service with an idempotent external id. The task system
owns task creation; this design only calls it.

## Requirement mapping

| Requirement | Design section |
| --- | --- |
| `REQ-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-001` | [Store](#store), [Propose](#propose) |
| `REQ-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-002` | [Approve](#approve), [Edits](#edits), [Recovery](#recovery), [Reserved prefix](#reserved-prefix) |
| `REQ-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-003` | [Reject](#reject) |
| `REQ-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-004` | [Routes](#routes), [Events](#events); client side in [proposal-cards.md](proposal-cards.md#client-store) |

## Store

Table `coordinator_proposals` in the coordinator store:

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | text primary key | UUID |
| `coordinator_id` | text not null | indexed with `status, created_at, id` |
| `workspace_id` | text not null | |
| `status` | text not null | `pending`, `approving`, `approved`, `rejected`, `failed` |
| `spec_json` | text not null | title, description, rationale, workflow, step, repository, source task |
| `final_spec_json` | text null | frozen at claim |
| `claimed_at` | timestamp null | set with `approving` |
| `claim_token` | text null | UUID generated per claim; fences completion |
| `task_id` | text null | set with `approved` |
| `error` | text null | set with `failed`, at most 1,000 characters |
| `reject_reason` | text null | at most 500 characters |
| `decided_by` | text null | user id |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamp not null | UTC |

## Propose

The `coordinator.propose_task` MCP action resolves the coordinator from the
principal, then in `internal/coordinator/proposals.go`:

1. Validates the fields of `AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-001.3` through the task,
   workflow and repository services. The step defaults to the workflow's start
   step. Eligibility reads the step's `on_enter` actions and `allow_manual_move`.
2. In one transaction, first takes a per-coordinator lock, then counts open
   proposals of the coordinator, refuses at 25, and inserts `pending`. On
   PostgreSQL the lock is `SELECT id FROM coordinators WHERE id = ? FOR
   UPDATE`, so concurrent proposes for one coordinator serialise on the
   coordinator row and a second transaction counts after the first commits;
   a missing row ends the transaction as 404. On SQLite the transaction is
   opened with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, taking the single write lock before the
   count. A store test on both dialects runs 30 concurrent proposes against a
   coordinator with 0 open proposals and asserts exactly 25 rows and 5
   refusals.
3. After commit publishes `coordinator.updated`.

There is no deduplication key.

## Approve

`POST .../proposals/:pid/approve` (`workspace.manage`), body optional edits
(see [Edits](#edits)):

1. Read the proposal (404 when it is absent or belongs to another coordinator
   or workspace) and decide by its status, before any edit is looked at or
   validated. The body "carries edits" when it has at least one of the five
   [Edits](#edits) fields, whatever their values; an empty body or `{}` carries
   none.
   - `approved` or `rejected`: 409 with the row.
   - `approving` and the body carries edits: 409 with the row, stale or not;
     the edits are neither validated nor applied.
   - `approving` with a claim that is not stale: 409 with the row.
   - `approving` with a stale claim and no edits: take the
     [stale re-claim](#stale-re-claim), which completes with the spec frozen
     by the first claim and does not validate it again.
   - `pending`: continue with step 2. A `pending` row has never been
     claimed, so no task holds its external id.
   - `failed`: first call `Service.GetTaskByExternalID(ctx, workspaceID,
     "coordinator-proposal:<id>")`. A task can exist here only when an
     earlier attempt's create committed after its claim was re-claimed and
     failed (step 5).
     - Found, and the body carries edits: 409 with the row. The edits are
       neither validated nor applied, and nothing is written or published.
       The task already exists with the frozen spec's fields and placement,
       so no edit could take effect.
     - Found, with no edits: skip step 2 and step 4. Claim as in step 3,
       with the row's `final_spec_json` unchanged as the frozen spec, then
       complete with the found task's id as step 4's `Found*` branches do,
       whatever the step's eligibility is now. No create call runs.
     - Not found: continue with step 2.
     - The lookup errors: 500; nothing is written or published.
2. Build the candidate spec: the base is `final_spec_json` when the row has
   one (a `failed` attempt), else `spec_json`; merge the edits and validate as
   in propose. 400 leaves the row unchanged. `spec_json` is never rewritten.
   A read that errors in steps 1 or 2 (the proposal read, or any read the
   validation makes, including the [step graph](#no-agent-starts)) returns
   500, writes nothing and publishes nothing; the row keeps its status. A
   workflow that no longer exists is not a read error: it is a validation
   failure (400 naming `workflow_id`), as in propose.
3. Claim, with a new UUID `T`: `UPDATE ... SET status='approving',
   claimed_at=now, claim_token=T, final_spec_json=?, decided_by=?, error=NULL
   WHERE id=? AND status IN ('pending','failed')`. When it matches no row, a
   concurrent request changed the row after step 1: re-read it; a row that is
   gone (its coordinator or workspace was deleted) returns 404, any other row
   returns 409 with that row. After a claim commits, publish
   `coordinator.updated`, so every open surface shows "Approval in progress"
   before the create runs.
4. Immediately before the create call, load the frozen spec's workflow step
   graph again and run `EligibleStep` on its step
   ([No agent starts](#no-agent-starts)). Every create call is preceded by
   this check: the original claimer's after step 3, and a
   [stale re-claim](#stale-re-claim)'s after its lookup found no task.
   - Ineligible (including a deleted workflow or step, which yields an
     empty graph or an unknown step): fail through step 5's fence with "the
     target step is no longer eligible". No create call runs.
   - The step-graph read errors: nothing further is written. The row stays
     `approving` under this claim's token, the error is logged at warn with
     the proposal id, and an approve request returns 500 (the startup pass
     moves on to its next row). The row is recovered as the stale re-claim's
     error rule says.

   When the step is eligible, create the task through the task service with the frozen spec, external
   id `coordinator-proposal:<id>` (with `AllowReservedExternalID`), origin the
   regular board origin, and no `start_agent`, no `prepare_session` and no
   `auto_start_on_create` metadata marker. The request sets no agent
   profile: the coordinator's profile belongs to its conversation, and the
   task resolves its agent at start through the orchestrator's
   `resolveTaskAgentProfile` (step, workflow, workspace default) like any
   board task (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-002.13`). Branch on the returned
   `CreateTaskResult.Outcome`:
   - `CreateTaskOutcomeCreated`: call `Service.SettleExternalID(ctx,
     task.ID, "coordinator-proposal:<id>")`, as the MCP and HTTP create
     handlers do. `settled=true`: complete with `task.ID`. `settled=false`
     (identity lost, which only a direct database change can cause, since
     release of the prefix is refused): complete with the survivor's id and
     log at warn. An error wrapping `taskrepo.ErrTaskNotFound` (the task was
     deleted while this create ran): fail with "The created task was deleted
     before approval completed" and leave `task_id` unset: the task no
     longer exists, so nothing was in fact created. Any other settle error:
     log it at warn and return the error to the caller without touching the
     row (step 5 does not run for this branch); the row stays `approving`
     with its existing claim, since the task exists but is not confirmed
     settled. Nothing retries it automatically while the process runs:
     the card shows no actions on an `approving` row
     (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-005.2`), so the row is recovered by the next
     [startup pass](#recovery), or earlier by an approve request sent
     through the API once the claim is stale. Either finds the task through
     the stale re-claim's external-id lookup and completes with it.
   - `CreateTaskOutcomeFoundSettled`: an earlier attempt created the task;
     complete with its id.
   - `CreateTaskOutcomeFoundUnsettled`: an earlier attempt created the task
     and stopped before settling. Complete with its id, as the external-id
     contract requires ("proceed with the returned task id"); never settle,
     release or re-create it, and log at info.
   - A create error: fail with it.
5. Complete: `UPDATE ... SET status='approved', task_id=?, claim_token=NULL
   WHERE id=? AND status='approving' AND claim_token=T`. Fail: the same fence
   sets `failed` with the error (truncated to 1,000 characters) and clears
   `claim_token`. When either update matches zero rows, re-read the row:
   - the row exists (another claimer re-claimed it after this one went
     stale): log at info and return 200 with the current row, writing
     nothing. When the other claimer creates, any task this request created
     is the one its create or lookup returns as found.

     When this request's outcome was `CreateTaskOutcomeCreated` and the
     current row is `failed`, the other claimer's stale re-claim found no
     task and failed the row on step 4's check before this request's create
     committed. When the current row is `rejected`, a manager then also
     rejected that `failed` row. Either way, log at warn with the proposal
     id and the task id, and still write nothing. The task is an ordinary
     task created with no agent start; this service never deletes it.
     - A later approve of the `failed` row finds the task through step 1's
       lookup. It completes with that task, or returns 409 when the request
       carries edits.
     - A reject leaves the task on its board.

     This is an accepted limitation. Step 4's check runs immediately before
     the create call, so reaching this state takes three things together:
     - this request's create call itself runs for more than two minutes;
     - the target step becomes ineligible during that call;
     - a second caller re-claims the row during that call.

     In this state the `failed` card's "Nothing was created"
     (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-005.3`) is false, and so is a reject's toast
     "Rejected. Nothing was created" (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-005.7`). The
     task can also sit on a step that is no longer eligible, where feeder
     promotion can start an agent (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-002.2`). The
     warn log is the only record;
   - the row is gone (its coordinator or workspace was deleted): log at info
     with the task id and return 404; the task stays on its board.
6. Publish `coordinator.updated`; return the proposal.

### Stale re-claim

`UPDATE ... SET claimed_at=now, claim_token=T WHERE id=? AND
status='approving' AND claimed_at < cutoff`, where `cutoff` is `now - 2
minutes` for an approve request and the startup time `T0` for the startup
pass (see [Recovery](#recovery)). It never writes
`final_spec_json` or `decided_by`, and it does not re-validate the frozen
spec's fields (title, description, workflow and repository existence): the
completion uses the spec frozen by the first claim and keeps the first
approver as `decided_by`. It does not skip the step-eligibility check:
when its lookup finds no task, its create goes through step 4, whose
[check](#no-agent-starts) runs against the frozen spec's workflow and step
immediately before the create call. Eligibility can have changed since the
original claim (an `on_enter` `auto_start_agent` action added to the target
step, or a new `pull_from_step_id` feeder link formed into an auto-starting
step), and recovery must not create the task on a step that is no longer
eligible. Before that, it first calls `Service.GetTaskByExternalID(ctx,
workspaceID, "coordinator-proposal:<id>")` (the same read the create
sequence's step-3 lookup and the REST lookup route already use), because an
earlier attempt may have created the task and crashed before this claim's
completion update ran. Found, it completes with that task's id exactly as
step 4's `FoundSettled` / `FoundUnsettled` branches do, and runs no
eligibility check, satisfying "a crash after the claim and a crash after the
create recover to one task" even when eligibility changed in between. Not
found, step 4's check governs. When that check fails, the re-claim still
commits (the row leaves `approving` either way), but the proposal is set
`failed` with "the target step is no longer eligible" and the task service
is never called to create one. This is the same failure shape as the
existing case where a frozen spec the task service no longer accepts fails
at the create in step 4 and sets the proposal `failed` with that error. A
workflow that no longer exists yields an empty step graph, and an unknown
step is ineligible, so a deleted workflow or step takes this same `failed`
branch.

After the re-claim commits, a lookup that errors (anything other than found
or not found) or a step-graph read that errors writes nothing further: the
row stays `approving` under this re-claim's token, the error is logged at
warn with the proposal id, an approve request returns 500, and the startup
pass moves on to its next row. The row is retried by the next startup pass,
or by an approve request once this re-claim is itself stale. It never
becomes `failed` on a read error, because a read error does not show that
the task was not created. An
approve request whose body carries edits never reaches the re-claim (step 1
refuses it with 409), so edits are never silently dropped; recovery callers
never send edits. A re-claim that commits publishes `coordinator.updated`,
then runs the lookup and, when no task is found, steps 4 to 6 with its
token. When it
matches no row, re-read the row: gone returns 404 (for a recovery reader, no
action); otherwise another reader won the re-claim and the request returns
409 with the current row (for a recovery reader, no action).

### No agent starts

The create request carries no session request and no
`auto_start_on_create` marker, and `handleTaskCreated`
(`internal/orchestrator/event_handlers_workflow.go`) evaluates the target
step's `on_enter` `auto_start_agent` only for a task carrying that marker
(`models.HasAutoStartOnCreateIntent`), so the direct-create path never starts
an agent whatever the target step's own actions are.

That marker is create-time only: `finalizeCreatedTask`
(`internal/task/service/service_tasks.go`) also runs feeder/WIP-limit
reconciliation synchronously after every create (`pullTasksFromNewFeederWork`
→ `promoteNextQueuedTask` → `promoteSameStepQueuedTask` /
`promoteFeederQueuedTask`, `internal/task/service/service_workflow.go`), and
the resulting `task.moved` / `task.queue_promoted` events reach
`handleTaskMovedNoSession` / `handleTaskQueuePromotedWithAutoStartOnCreateClaimed`
(`internal/orchestrator/event_handlers_workflow.go`), neither of which checks
`HasAutoStartOnCreateIntent`, by design, since those handlers represent a
task entering a step via an ordinary transition, which is meant to auto-start
regardless of how the task was created. A task created on a step that feeds
an available auto-start step would therefore auto-start immediately despite
carrying no marker, defeating this guarantee.

Eligibility closes this at the placement boundary instead of the create-time
boundary: an **eligible step** (defined in
[requirements/proposals.md](../requirements/proposals.md#terminology)) is
also refused when it is a feeder, directly or through a chain of
`pull_from_step_id` links, of any step with an `on_enter` `auto_start_agent`
action. It is validated at propose, again before the claim (approve step
2), and again immediately before every create call (approve step 4, for the
original claimer and for a [stale re-claim](#stale-re-claim) alike). A step
or feeder graph that changed after proposing, after the claim, or during the
recovery window is therefore caught each time, and a proposal can only ever
land somewhere a manager could place a task by hand *and leave it there*,
never somewhere the workflow itself would immediately relocate it into an
auto-starting step. The check has two parts:

- **The walk.** task-01 implemented it as the pure function
  `EligibleStep(steps []StepNode, stepID string) bool`
  (`internal/coordinator/eligibility.go`). It takes the workflow's full step
  graph, not just the candidate step, so it can check reachability; an
  unknown step id is ineligible.
- **The loader.** One function in `internal/coordinator/step_graph.go` reads
  a workflow's steps through the workflow service's `ListStepsByWorkflow`
  (behind a narrow interface the coordinator package declares) and maps
  each step to a `StepNode`: `ID`, `IsStart` from `is_start_step`,
  `AllowManualMove` from `allow_manual_move`, `AutoStartOnEnter` when any
  `on_enter` action is `auto_start_agent`, and `PullFromStepID` from
  `pull_from_step_id`. A workflow with no steps, including one that no
  longer exists, yields an empty graph. The loader does not authorize; its
  callers have already authorized the workspace or run as the unscoped
  startup pass.

task-03 calls the loader and the walk at propose time; task-07 calls them
again before the claim and before every create call. Tasks 03 and 07 run in parallel,
so each work order builds the loader at that path if it is absent when it
branches. Whichever of the two merges second deletes its own copy and calls
the one already on `main`, so exactly one loader exists after both merge.
This is the same merge-last rule the work orders use for task 03's
no-turn-start table.

### Edits

The approve body fields are `title`, `description`, `workflow_id`, `step_id`
and `repository_id`. For each:

| Sent as | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| absent | unchanged |
| JSON `null` | 400 naming the field; nothing changes |
| `""` for `title` | 400 (empty after trimming) |
| `""` for `description` | clears the description |
| `""` for `workflow_id` | 400 (a workflow is required) |
| `""` for `step_id` | clears the step, so the workflow's start step is used |
| `""` for `repository_id` | clears the repository; the task has none |
| a value | replaces the field, then the spec is validated |

When `workflow_id` changes and `step_id` is absent, the step resets to the new
workflow's start step. `rationale` and `source_task_id` are not editable; like
any unknown field they are ignored. Strings are trimmed before validation. An
empty body, or `{}`, approves the base spec unchanged.

## Reject

`POST .../proposals/:pid/reject` (`workspace.manage`), body `{reason?}`, in
the same order as approve: read the proposal (404 when absent or of another
coordinator or workspace); a status other than `pending` or `failed` returns
409 with the row; then the reason is read and trimmed, and a reason over 500
characters returns 400 with the row unchanged; then `UPDATE ... SET status='rejected',
reject_reason=?, decided_by=? WHERE id=? AND status IN ('pending','failed')`.
When it matches no row, re-read the row: gone returns 404, any other row
returns 409 with that row.

The reason is handled as follows:

| Sent as | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| absent, JSON `null`, `""` or only whitespace | `reject_reason` stored as SQL `NULL`; the API returns `reject_reason: null` and the card shows no reason |
| a string of 1 to 500 code points after trimming | stored trimmed |
| over 500 code points after trimming | 400 naming `reason`; nothing changes |
| any other JSON type | 400 naming `reason`; nothing changes |

Unknown body fields are ignored. An empty body or `{}` rejects with no reason.
Reject is allowed from `failed` so that a
proposal that cannot be created can be closed, matching the failed-card
design (UI-03 in the [plan](../../../plans/workspace-coordinator/plan.md)).
This departs from the source analysis plan (`implementation-plan.md`
revision 9, section 6.5.4, kept outside this repository), which allowed
reject from `pending` only. The approve claim and the reject share the
same condition, `WHERE id=? AND status IN ('pending','failed')`, and each sets
a status outside that set (`approving` or `rejected`). The row's `status` is
therefore an atomic compare-and-swap: whichever UPDATE commits first matches
one row, and the other then matches none, re-reads and returns 409 with the
winner's row. A racing approve and reject cannot both succeed.

## Recovery

Three callers recover a stale `approving` claim: the startup pass, a
once-a-minute sweep and an approve request. A proposal read never writes.
The callers, their cutoffs, order, errors and races are specified in
[proposal approval recovery](proposal-recovery.md#recovery).

## Reserved prefix

The prefix is enforced in the task service, so every entry point inherits it:

- `CreateTaskRequest` gains `AllowReservedExternalID bool` tagged `json:"-"`,
  so no HTTP or MCP body can set it. `Service.CreateTask`, after
  `NormalizeExternalID`, refuses a value starting `coordinator-proposal:` with
  `ErrExternalIDInvalid` (400 at the HTTP and MCP handlers) unless the flag is
  set. Only the coordinator service sets it.
- `Service.ReleaseTaskExternalID` refuses a value starting
  `coordinator-proposal:` with `ErrExternalIDInvalid`, so
  `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:id/tasks/by-external-id`
  (`httpReleaseTaskExternalID`) returns 400 and the id stays bound to its
  task. The coordinator service never releases these ids.
- Task-service tests cover create through HTTP and MCP with the prefix (400),
  create with the flag (created), and release with the prefix (400, binding
  unchanged).

## Routes

| Route | Scope | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET .../coordinators/:cid/proposals?status=pending\|all` | `workspace.read` | open, `created_at` asc then id asc; or newest 50, desc; 400 naming `status` for any other value |
| `GET .../coordinators/:cid/proposals/:pid` | `workspace.read` | one proposal |
| `POST .../proposals/:pid/approve` | `workspace.manage` | proposal, 400, 403, 404 or 409 |
| `POST .../proposals/:pid/reject` | `workspace.manage` | proposal, 400, 403, 404 or 409 |

Routes live under `/api/v1/workspaces/:id/`. A proposal of another
coordinator or workspace is 404. Both reads need only `workspace.read` and
never write: stale-claim recovery runs only in the startup pass, the sweep
and on approve ([Recovery](#recovery)). The coordinator list response carries
`open_proposals` per coordinator for the sidebar badge.

## Events

Every proposal write publishes `coordinator.updated` after it commits, with
`{workspace_id, coordinator_id, open_proposals}`: insert, claim, stale
re-claim, completion, failure and reject. A write that matched zero rows
publishes nothing. `open_proposals` is counted after the write commits.
When that count or the publish fails, the error is logged at warn and the
request's result is unchanged: the write stands and no event is sent, the
same log-and-continue rule as the task service's own event publishing. The forwarder in
`gateway/websocket/coordinator_notifications.go` sends it to clients
subscribed to the workspace, as other workspace notifications do.

## Client store and cards

The client proposal store and the proposal cards (both surfaces) are in
[proposal-cards.md](proposal-cards.md).

## Security

- Decisions authorise at the backend by workspace scope; the principal of the
  MCP action is resolved server-side.
- Approve and reject are not on the coordinator's MCP surface, and the MCP
  guard refuses both from a coordinator principal and from a principal it
  cannot resolve (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-002.15`). Three layers make this
  hold, each tested:
  1. **No MCP path.** Approve and reject are reachable only through the two
     REST routes of [Routes](#routes). No MCP tool is registered for them
     and no MCP action handler calls the proposal service's approve or
     reject; the only proposal actions on MCP are `coordinator.propose_task`
     and the read `coordinator.get_item`.
  2. **Reserved names in the guard.** `internal/coordinator/mcpcontract`
     reserves `coordinator.approve_proposal` and `coordinator.reject_proposal`
     as `DecisionActions`; they are never registered. The first check in
     `authorizeCoordinatorRequest`, before the propose check and before the
     allowlist, refuses either name with the unknown-action error when the
     principal is a coordinator or when the context carries no principal,
     and nothing changes. Other callers reach the dispatcher, which answers
     an unregistered action as unknown. Every other action keeps today's
     rule: a request with no principal in context passes through the guard
     (non-session callers rely on this).
  3. **Unresolved in-session principal.** Inside a session the dispatcher
     (`internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/mcp_identity.go`) already refuses
     any action with `INTERNAL_ERROR` "failed to resolve the session
     principal" when the principal cannot be resolved, before the guard or
     any handler runs.
  The guard's table test runs every registered action plus both reserved
  names for a coordinator principal, no principal and an ordinary principal,
  and asserts the reserved names are refused for the first two and never
  appear in the allowlist or in the registered action set. The REST routes cannot
  tell a person's browser from an agent's shell while `features.auth` is
  off; that residual is recorded in the
  [ADR](../../../decisions/2026-09-26-workspace-coordinator.md#residual-risk-the-agents-own-tools),
  and no user-facing copy claims more than the guard enforces.
- A proposal read never writes, so no request, from any site, can trigger
  recovery or otherwise mutate a proposal through a read route.
- Spec strings are untrusted; the cards render them as text.
- The created task is ordinary; the coordinator gains no authority over it.

## Observability

Propose, claim, approve, fail, reject and recovery log at info with the
proposal, coordinator and workspace ids; failures carry the error.
