# Needs you and Queue System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

Needs you and Queue are a client projection over three inputs: the workspace's
tasks as the web client already holds them, the coordinator's stall records
and its open proposals. The task system owns `statusSummary`, `task.stalled`
and task state; this design consumes them and adds no task field.

## Inputs

- **Tasks:** `useAllWorkflowSnapshots`
  (`apps/web/hooks/domains/kanban/use-all-workflow-snapshots.ts`), stored in
  `kanbanMulti.snapshots`, kept current by `task.status_summary.updated` and the
  task WebSocket handlers. Snapshots hold every open task, so there is no
  paging cap. Each task carries `statusSummary`
  (`apps/web/lib/types/task-status-summary.ts`): `pending_action` (the
  string `"clarification"` or `"permission"` when set), `active_error` and
  `task_error` (each `TaskStatusSummaryActiveError`, text in `preview`),
  `pull_request.aggregate_state`, `last_activity_at`, `primary_session`
  (`{id, state}` or null), and the task `state`.
- **Pull request detail:** the GitHub slice's `taskPRs.byTaskId`
  (`apps/web/lib/state/slices/github/types.ts`), loaded by `useWorkspacePRs`
  (`apps/web/hooks/domains/github/use-task-pr.ts`, which calls
  `listWorkspaceTaskPRs`) and kept current by the existing PR WebSocket
  handlers. The row uses the task's primary PR (`getPrimaryTaskPR`): `state`,
  `unresolved_review_threads` and `checks_state`. This design adds no PR
  field.
- **Stall records:** `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:id/coordinator-stalls`
  (`workspace.read`), returning `{stalls: [{task_id, stalled_for_ms,
  last_event_at, detected_at}]}` ordered by `task_id`. Re-read on each screen
  mount, on **Try again** and on the `task.stalled`-driven
  `coordinator.updated` event (below).
- **Proposals:** `GET .../coordinators/:cid/proposals?status=pending` through
  `listProposals` in `apps/web/lib/api/domains/coordinator-api.ts`. Until the
  proposal store of [proposals](proposals.md)
  (`hooks/domains/coordinator/use-proposals.ts`) exists, the screens read it
  through the screen-level inputs hook below; once that store exists, the
  proposals input is read from it and the hook's own proposals read is
  removed.
- **Watch set (phase 2 only):** the coordinator's effective watch set from
  `GET .../coordinators/:cid/settings`, through `useCoordinatorWatchSet`; tasks
  and stalls are filtered by it before classification
  ([permissions](permissions-ui.md#client-watch-filter)). Not read while the phase-2
  flag is off.
- **Screen inputs hook:** `apps/web/app/coordinator/use-coordinator-inputs.ts`
  holds the stall records and pending proposals for the viewed coordinator,
  each as `{value, loadedAt, error}`: `value` is the last successful response
  (absent before the first success), `loadedAt` its receive time, and `error`
  is set while the latest read of that input failed. It never holds tasks,
  which stay in `kanbanMulti.snapshots`.

## Classification

`apps/web/lib/coordinator/attention.ts` exports a pure function
`classify(tasks, stalls, proposals, now)` returning `{needsYou: Item[],
queue: {working, inReview, readyToMerge, done, other}, counts}`. It is covered
by Vitest, one case per group, one per precedence pair, the equal-timestamp
stall case, the unreadable-session cases with and without a stall row, and
the mixed-validity case below (unreadable session, `state == "COMPLETED"`).

Rules, first match wins, excluding tasks with `archived_at` set or
`is_ephemeral` true:

| Group | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| question or permission | `pending_action` is `"clarification"` or `"permission"` |
| stall | a stall row for the task and (`last_activity_at` absent or `last_activity_at <= detected_at`) |
| error | `active_error` or `task_error` present |
| Ready to merge | `pull_request.aggregate_state == "ready"` |
| In review | `pull_request.aggregate_state == "awaiting_review"` |
| Working | `primary_session.state` in `RUNNING`, `STARTING` |
| Done | task `state == "COMPLETED"` |
| Other | otherwise, including a task whose session is unreadable |

A task's session is **unreadable** when its `statusSummary` is absent, or
`primary_session` is present with no `state`. The rules are still evaluated in
order for it, with every `statusSummary`-derived field read as absent: the
question, error, pull request and Working rules cannot match, since each
reads a `statusSummary` field (`pending_action`, `active_error`/`task_error`,
`pull_request`, `primary_session.state`). The Done rule is not one of these:
it reads the task's own `state` column, which exists independently of the
session and is never absent, so Done still matches a task whose session is
unreadable. The stall rule matches when a stall row exists, because an absent
`last_activity_at` counts the stall as current
(`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-001.4`), so such a task is a stall item. A task
with an unreadable session, no stall row and `state != "COMPLETED"` lands in
Other, and its row shows "position underivable: session unreadable" in place
of the agent state. A task with `primary_session` null has no session, which
is not unreadable: its row shows "No session".

Vitest covers the mixed-validity case: an unreadable session
(`statusSummary` absent) with `state == "COMPLETED"` classifies as Done, not
Other.

Each open proposal is an item of kind `proposal`, independent of tasks.

Item reference time: proposal `created_at`; stall `last_event_at`; otherwise
`last_activity_at`, falling back to the task's `updated_at`. Needs you sorts
by reference time ascending, then kind rank (proposal 0, question 1, stall 2,
error 3), then id by code-unit comparison. Queue groups sort by
`last_activity_at` descending with absent values last, then task id
ascending by the same code-unit comparison (`a < b` on the strings, never
`localeCompare`). Age is rendered from `now`, re-evaluated every 30 seconds by the
screen's timer.

The error why-text is "The agent reported an error: " plus
`active_error.preview` truncated to 140 characters when `active_error` is
present (an empty preview leaves the text ending after the colon and space).
With only `task_error` it is exactly "The task failed"; `task_error.preview`
is not shown on the item (**Open task** shows it on the task), matching
`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-002.2`.

In review and Ready to merge rows show the primary PR's `state`,
`unresolved_review_threads` and `checks_state`. When `taskPRs.byTaskId` holds
no PR for the task (PR data not loaded, failed to load, or the provider is not
GitHub), the row shows the `pull_request.state` from `statusSummary` and the
text "PR detail unavailable" in place of the thread count and CI state.

A proposal item's head uses the source task when it is present in the
snapshots and not archived, else "New task" with no step. `Ask about this`
uses the source task identifier, else the proposal title.

## Stall records

Table `coordinator_stalls` in the coordinator store:

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task_id` | text primary key | |
| `workspace_id` | text not null | indexed |
| `stalled_for_ms` | integer not null | parsed from the event's Go duration string |
| `last_event_at` | timestamp not null | from the event |
| `detected_at` | timestamp not null | the subscriber's receive time, UTC |

The `task.stalled` subscriber (`internal/coordinator/stalls.go`) reads
`task_id`, `workspace_id`, `stalled_for` and `last_event_at` from the payload.
It checks for at least one coordinator in the workspace; with none it returns.
Otherwise it upserts the row with `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (task_id) DO UPDATE
SET stalled_for_ms = excluded.stalled_for_ms, last_event_at =
excluded.last_event_at, detected_at = excluded.detected_at, workspace_id =
excluded.workspace_id WHERE excluded.last_event_at >
coordinator_stalls.last_event_at` (valid on SQLite and PostgreSQL). A newer
stall episode replaces the row; an event with an equal or earlier
`last_event_at` (a redelivery, or events handled out of order) changes
nothing, so detection time never moves forward for an episode already
recorded and a late event never overwrites a newer one. Only when a row was
inserted or updated (one affected row) does it publish `coordinator.updated`
for each coordinator of the workspace, so open screens re-read stalls. A
publish that returns an error is logged at warn with the task, workspace and
coordinator ids, and the subscriber continues with the next coordinator. The
row stays written and nothing is retried: a redelivered event changes nothing
by design, so an open screen shows the stall on its next stalls read (screen
mount, **Try again**, or any later `coordinator.updated` for that
coordinator). `detection_only` is ignored: main publishes it as
`true` on every event, and recording never acts. A payload that fails to parse
is logged at warn and dropped.

The startup pass deletes rows whose task is missing or archived (one query
joining the task table through the task repository's read interface) and rows
with `detected_at` older than 30 days. There is no timer.

## Routes and sidebar

- `apps/web/src/spa-routes.tsx` adds `/workspaces/:id/coordinator`,
  `/workspaces/:id/coordinator/:coordinatorId` and `.../queue`, resolved by a
  flag-gated resolver modelled on `resolveNeedsYouInboxRoute`; the pages live in
  `apps/web/app/coordinator/`.
- The generic route redirects to the first coordinator by the list order, or
  renders the no-coordinator state. An unknown id renders the no-coordinator
  state when the workspace has no coordinator, and otherwise the
  unknown-coordinator state ("This coordinator is not in this workspace.",
  **See coordinators** linking to `/settings/workspaces/:id/coordinators`, no
  strip, no list, no **Add a coordinator**). While the coordinator list has not
  loaded, neither state renders; if its read fails, the route shows "Could not
  load coordinators." with **Try again**, which re-reads the list
  (`listCoordinators`). The sidebar entries are unaffected.
- `components/app-sidebar/sections/coordinators-section.tsx` renders the
  entries as a `CoordinatorsSection` built on `AppSidebarSection`, the way
  `AutomationsSection` is: id `coordinators` in `APP_SIDEBAR_SECTION_IDS`,
  mounted immediately above the Automations section (in `app-sidebar.tsx` and,
  for a saved layout, beside the automations node in
  `sidebar-layout-navigation.tsx`). It self-gates on the flag and an active
  workspace and renders nothing until the list has loaded. Rows link to the
  Needs you screen with the open-proposal badge; `defaultExpanded` is true, and
  the folded `collapsedSummary` is the badge sum when above zero, otherwise the
  coordinator count. The header shortcut links to `/workspaces/:id/coordinator`;
  with no coordinator the body is one "Set up a coordinator" row
  (`sidebar-coordinators-empty`) linking to the settings list. The phone menu uses
  `MobileCoordinatorsSection` (`components/navigation/mobile-coordinators-section.tsx`),
  built like `MobileAutomationsSection`: a header toggle with `aria-expanded` and
  `aria-controls`, the list shortcut, and the rows, all 44px targets. It shares the
  desktop `appSidebar.sectionExpanded.coordinators` state (default expanded), folded
  summary and empty row (`mobile-sidebar-coordinators-empty`). It is mounted above the
  automations node in `mobile-sidebar-layout-navigation.tsx`, or in
  `MobileRequiredRows` when the layout has no automations node. Badge values come from a small store keyed by coordinator id, seeded by
  the list route's `open_proposals` field and replaced by each
  `coordinator.updated` payload.

## Screens

- `apps/web/app/coordinator/` holds the Needs you and Queue pages, the count
  strip (sticky, outside the scroller), the item card with per-kind actions,
  the Queue groups (Done and Other use a collapsed disclosure), and the empty,
  missing and error states.
- The page chrome is the topbar, not a header in the body:
  `coordinator-route-content.tsx` owns the `PageShell`, because the coordinator
  the crumb names is not known until that component has resolved it. The crumb
  is `PageShell`'s `titleSlot` (`CoordinatorTitleSlot`: the coordinator as a
  link, or a `Select` when the workspace has several, then the screen's own
  name), and **Configure** is a topbar action for managers. A page client
  renders no shell of its own. The count strip is therefore the first thing
  under the topbar, and the content column is left-aligned rather than
  centred, as in mockup v2.1.
- The strip spans the window rather than the content column, with the
  derived-facts line as a caption at its far end rather than a paragraph
  beneath it (AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-003.3, mockup v2.1 `.strip`). Beside
  the counts only fits at that width, so the caption is dropped below `lg`
  rather than allowed to wrap the row.
- Phone: one column; the strip stays sticky; actions wrap with 44px minimum
  targets. Playwright checks run in the `mobile-chrome` project at 390px, and an
  axe scan asserts no critical violation on both screens.
- Copy uses `t()` in six locales; no Unicode em dash.

## Failure and recovery

Each input keeps its last successful value with its load time: tasks through
`workspaceContextRead` (below), stall records and proposals through
`use-coordinator-inputs.ts`. One banner shows one line per failed input, in
the order tasks, stall records, proposals, each with that input's own load
time (`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-007.3`), or the timeless sentence when that
input has never loaded (`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-007.5`). Times render as
local `HH:mm`. The lists render from the inputs that did load: a never-loaded
stall input classifies with no stall rows, a never-loaded proposals input with
no proposal items. **Try again** re-issues only the failed reads, in parallel;
each input clears its line when its own read succeeds. A read that fails again
keeps the previous `value` and `loadedAt`.

The tasks input is read per workflow by `useAllWorkflowSnapshots`, which
reports one result per workspace refresh through `setWorkspaceSnapshotRead`
into `workspaceContextRead` (`snapshotPending`, `snapshotError`). The tasks
input has failed while `snapshotError` is set, which the hook does when any
workflow's fetch failed. Its load time is the time the screen last saw
`snapshotPending` turn false with `snapshotError` null; before that it has no
load time. The lists and counts always classify the tasks of every workflow
present in `kanbanMulti.snapshots`, so a partial failure shows the workflows
that loaded, with the banner. When no workflow snapshot is present and the
read failed, the lists and the count strip are replaced by the banner.
**Try again** for tasks calls `requestWorkspaceContextRefresh()`, which makes
the hook re-fetch only the workflows that failed. While the phase-2 flag is on the banner may also carry a fourth line for the
watch set, after the proposals line, with its own load time and the same
first-load and re-read wording rules; it is specified in
[permissions](permissions-ui.md#client-watch-filter) and adds no case to
`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-007.3` to `007.5`, which are unchanged with the
flag off. A failed PR detail read is not a banner case: rows fall back
as described in [Classification](#classification). A copilot session failure is contained in the copilot panel and does not
affect these inputs.

## Security

The stalls route authorises `workspace.read` and filters by workspace. The
screens write nothing except proposal decisions, which are authorised by their
own routes.

## Observability

The subscriber logs recorded and skipped stalls at debug level and parse
failures at warn, with task and workspace ids. The startup pass logs counts
pruned.
