# Workspace File Transfer Requirements

## Overview

The Files panel lets a person read and edit the task workspace, but it cannot move bytes across the
browser boundary in either direction with any reliability. There is no upload at all: the workspace
file contract exposes create, update-by-diff, rename, and delete, and none of them accept raw file
content. Download exists but is reachable from exactly one place, a single-file right-click, so the
surfaces where downloading is the only sensible action offer no way to do it.

That gap forces people out of the workbench. Getting a fixture, a screenshot, a certificate, or a
vendor export into the workspace means a terminal, an agent instruction, or a commit. Getting a
generated archive or PDF back out means the same trip in reverse, from a screen that has already
told the user it cannot preview the file.

Chat attachments partly cover the inbound case, but they are a different tool: they are addressed to
a turn rather than to the workspace, so they interrupt the conversation and are awkward when the
file is remembered late. They also do not help someone running Kandev on a headless machine who
needs to push a file from their laptop, which is the case that motivated this most strongly in
review.

This system owns the contract because the durable outcome is a Files-panel capability: which
surfaces offer transfer, what the person sees while it runs, and how a collision or failure is
presented. The transport it uses (session-scoped agentctl HTTP, the workspace path-containment
rules, and the attachment streaming pattern) belongs to adjacent systems and is consumed here, not
redefined.

## Terminology

- **Transfer:** Moving file bytes between the browser and the task workspace in either direction.
- **Destination folder:** The workspace-relative directory an upload targets. The workspace root is
  the empty path.
- **Unpreviewable file:** A workspace file the editor cannot render as text or as an image, shown
  today on the binary viewer screen.
- **Conflict:** A selected file whose destination path already exists in the workspace.
- **Preflight:** The check that reports conflicts for a whole selection before any byte is uploaded.
- **Resolution:** The choice a person makes for a conflicting file: replace, keep both, or skip.

## Requirements

### REQ-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001: Manual upload into the task workspace

**Intent:** A person working in a task can put a file from their machine into the task workspace
without leaving the workbench, using the same panel they already use to browse it.

**User story:** As a person working in a task, I want to upload a file into a chosen workspace
folder, so that I can supply fixtures, exports, and assets without a terminal or an agent detour.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.1:** The Files panel's create control offers **New File**,
  **Upload Files**, and **Upload Folder**. Choosing New File begins the existing inline
  file-creation flow with unchanged behavior; the two upload choices open the operating system's
  file picker and folder picker respectively.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.2:** Right-clicking a folder in the file tree offers **Upload
  files here**, targeting that folder. The action is absent for files and absent when more than one
  node is selected.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.3:** The picker accepts more than one file at a time, and each
  selected file is uploaded to the destination folder. When no folder is the active target, the
  destination is the workspace root.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.4:** A person can upload a folder. Its directory structure is
  recreated under the destination, intermediate directories are created as needed, and each
  contained file lands at its corresponding relative path.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.5:** While an upload runs, the panel shows that it is in
  progress. On success, each uploaded file appears in the file tree at its destination without a
  manual refresh, and the confirmation names the path it was written to.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.6:** An upload that fails before publication leaves no partial
  or truncated destination file, removes any optimistic tree entry, and reports why it failed.
  A later transport failure does not imply that a completed workspace write was rolled back.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-001.7:** Upload is offered only when the panel has an active task
  session. Without one, the actions are absent rather than present and failing.

### REQ-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004: Conflicts are resolved before anything is written

**Intent:** A person decides what happens to each colliding file, and makes that decision knowing the
full set of conflicts, before any byte reaches the workspace.

**User story:** As a person uploading files, I want to be told which files already exist and choose
what to do, so that I never silently replace work or discover a surprise rename afterwards.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.1:** Before any content is uploaded, the selection's
  destination paths are checked against the workspace and every conflict is reported as one result.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.2:** When there is no conflict, the upload proceeds with no
  additional prompt.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.3:** When there is at least one conflict, the person is shown
  which files conflict and chooses **Replace**, **Keep both**, or **Skip** for them. A choice can be
  applied to every remaining conflict at once.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.4:** **Keep both** writes the incoming file under the next
  available `name-<n>.ext` variant and leaves the existing file untouched. **Skip** writes nothing for that file. **Replace** overwrites it.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.5:** Cancelling the resolution uploads nothing at all, not
  even the files that had no conflict.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.6:** A resolution is honored per file. Uploading without a
  resolution for a conflicting path is refused rather than defaulting to overwrite, including when a
  conflicting path is created between the preflight and the upload.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.7:** When **Replace** succeeds against an existing regular
  file, the complete incoming bytes shall retain the destination's supported ordinary permissions
  observed at the final publication check, rather than its earlier preflight state. On POSIX this
  includes read, write, and execute bits: an executable script shall remain directly runnable, and
  a restricted file shall not gain broader access. Windows coverage is limited to the supported
  writable/read-only attribute and native replacement restrictions, without POSIX mode equivalence.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.8:** A newly created destination, including **Replace** when
  the destination no longer exists and the new copy from **Keep both**, shall use ordinary upload
  creation defaults subject to the caller's umask where supported. It shall not inherit the old
  file's permissions or widen a restrictive umask. **Keep both** shall preserve the original file's
  bytes and permissions.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-004.9:** When replacement fails before publication, the existing
  destination's bytes and permissions shall remain unchanged, the staged upload shall be cleaned
  up, and no successful workspace-change notification shall be emitted. This does not promise
  rollback of a write already published before a later transport failure.

### REQ-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002: Download reachable from every file surface

**Intent:** Downloading a file is offered from the surfaces where a person is actually looking at
that file, not only from a right-click in the tree.

**User story:** As a person viewing a workspace file, I want to download it from the screen I am
already on, so that I do not have to hunt for the file again in the tree.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.1:** The file editor header offers a download action for the
  open file, in both the Monaco and CodeMirror editors, with the same placement, icon, and
  accessible name in each.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.2:** The unpreviewable-file screen offers a download action.
  Download is the primary useful action on that screen, which otherwise offers none.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.3:** The image viewer offers the same download action, since
  it shares the viewer header contract with the unpreviewable-file screen.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.4:** Downloading from a viewer uses the file content the
  viewer already holds and does not re-request it.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.5:** A downloaded file keeps its original bytes and its
  original file name. Content that is not text is not corrupted by the transfer.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-002.6:** The existing single-file download in the tree's
  right-click menu keeps its current behavior and placement.

### REQ-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003: Safe and bounded transfer

**Intent:** Upload is the first path that writes caller-supplied bytes into a task workspace, so its
containment, size, and concurrency behavior are part of the contract rather than an implementation
detail.

**User story:** As an operator, I want workspace uploads to be bounded and contained, so that the
feature cannot write outside the workspace, exhaust memory, or corrupt a file an agent is reading.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.1:** An upload destination that escapes the task workspace, by
  traversal, by absolute path, or through a symlinked directory, is rejected and writes nothing.
  This applies to every path segment supplied by a folder upload, not only the destination folder.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.2:** A single uploaded file larger than the message-attachment
  limit is rejected with a size-specific message, and the rejection is reported per file rather than
  failing the whole selection.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.3:** Upload requires the same authenticated identity as other
  workspace mutations. An unauthenticated request is refused.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.4:** An upload is never observable by the agent as a partially
  written file. The destination path either does not exist or holds the complete uploaded content.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.5:** Uploaded bytes are streamed end to end. No layer holds a
  whole file in memory or encodes it as base64.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.6:** A completed upload emits the same workspace change
  notification as the other file mutations, so the file tree and Git status converge without a
  manual refresh.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.7:** When the upload-owning Files surface is disposed or
  changes its active session, every unfinished selection owned by the previous surface/session
  shall be retired. A retired selection shall start no further preflight or upload requests and
  shall publish no conflict dialog, per-file state, or success/failure confirmation to that surface
  or its replacement. This applies equally to desktop and phone entry points.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.8:** Retirement shall settle the selection's caller with a
  cancelled outcome. A selection waiting only for conflict choices shall settle during cleanup
  without requiring a dialog action. A selection awaiting an already dispatched preflight or file
  upload shall settle when that request completes or fails, without requiring any further request
  or user action. Resolving conflicts shall retain this settlement guarantee during file uploads.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.9:** Retirement shall preserve confirmed successful writes
  and failures, including the result of an upload already in flight, in the caller's cancelled
  outcome. It shall preserve skipped-selection evidence. Retirement does not abort or roll back an
  in-flight workspace mutation, remove a successfully written file, or emit a stale confirmation.
- **AC-UI-WORKSPACE-FILE-TRANSFER-003.10:** Retirement of one upload owner or session shall not
  cancel another owner's selection or prevent a live replacement session from uploading. Late
  responses and retained callbacks from a retired lifetime shall not affect the current selection.
  Development lifecycle cleanup followed by setup shall leave the live owner able to upload.

## Out of scope

- Dragging files or folders from the operating system onto the file tree. The tree's existing
  internal drag-to-move behavior is unchanged, and no external-drop branch is added to it.
- Downloading a folder, or downloading more than one selected file, as an archive.
- Replacing the 10 MB workspace read cap, or the streaming download endpoint that would be needed to
  transfer a file above it.
- The separate defect where a file above the read cap leaves the editor on its loading state
  indefinitely.
- Uploading into anything other than the active task session's workspace.
- Version history, restore, or any retention policy for replaced files.
- Transferring source-file permissions from the browser or preserving destination ownership,
  ACLs, extended attributes, or special privilege bits (setuid, setgid, sticky). Permission
  preservation applies to regular-file replacement and only to bits supported by the native OS;
  it does not introduce a cross-platform metadata contract.

## Related work

- Chat attachments already stream multipart from the browser through the backend into agentctl. That
  contract is owned by the task-attachment path and is the exemplar this capability follows; it is
  not modified here.
