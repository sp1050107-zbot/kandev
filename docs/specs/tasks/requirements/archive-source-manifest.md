# Task Cleanup Source Manifest Requirements

## Overview

Archive and delete cleanup removes task worktrees. The task system must retain
evidence of the source state that existed immediately before removal so a
Coordinator can audit the task's terminal integrity after the checkout is gone.
The task system owns the cleanup lifecycle and durable task association; the
workspace system continues to own Git worktree registration and file capture.

## Terminology

- **Source manifest:** A task-scoped record of Git identities and changed-path
  content hashes captured for a cleanup job.
- **Cleanup boundary:** The point after all recorded runtime stop operations
  succeed and before cleanup removes any task worktree.

## Requirements

### REQ-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001: Preserve task source evidence

**Intent:** Preserve verifiable, secret-free evidence for task source state at
the cleanup boundary.

**User story:** As a Coordinator, I want to inspect the source state associated
with an archived or deleted task, so that I can audit its terminal integrity.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.1:** Before archive or delete cleanup
  removes any worktree, the cleanup job shall durably persist the source
  manifest for every captured task worktree. A retry shall reuse persisted
  evidence, and a failed capture or persistence shall leave the worktree intact.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.2:** Each manifest shall bind the exact
  task, cleanup job, environment, worktree, and repository identities. Capture
  shall verify that the path is a registered worktree of the recorded
  repository; uncertain or foreign ownership shall block cleanup.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.3:** Evidence shall include HEAD,
  a digest of Git's staged-index records, tracked and untracked status, and
  content digests for changed paths. It shall retain no source bytes or
  dereferenced symlink data. The staged-index digest shall include unmerged
  stages without writing Git objects. Dirty submodules shall have a stable
  digest of their working-tree contents. Ignored directory entries follow
  `AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.7`.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.4:** Git metadata, index, status, path,
  or content capture failures shall be recorded as a recoverable cleanup error
  and shall block destructive cleanup. A disappeared untracked path shall not
  be recorded as a deletion.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.5:** An authorized workspace member
  shall be able to retrieve retained source manifests for a task, including
  after task deletion. A foreign workspace caller shall receive the existing
  task-not-found response.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.6:** Captures shall not combine or
  attribute content from another task or repository.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.7:** When Git identifies an ignored
  directory entry, evidence shall retain its path and ignored status without
  reading descendant contents. Evidence shall explicitly distinguish this
  omission from deletion. Ignored regular files shall retain content digests.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.8:** When an attempt expires or the
  backend cancels capture, capture shall stop between directory entries and
  file-read chunks. It shall return the cancellation cause and leave the
  worktree intact. Partial evidence shall not authorize cleanup.
- **AC-TASKS-ARCHIVE-SOURCE-MANIFEST-001.9:** Due source-manifest cleanup shall
  run in the owned background worker without delaying backend readiness.
  Recovery shall begin without a timer delay and retry repository errors.
  Shutdown shall cancel and join that worker before releasing backend ownership.

## Out of scope

- Reconstructing source state for tasks archived before this requirement was
  implemented.
- Retaining source file contents or changing normal clean-task lifecycle
  behavior after successful evidence capture.
