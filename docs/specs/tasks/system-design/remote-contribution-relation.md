# Remote Contribution Relation Evidence

## Boundary and requirement mapping

Tasks owns comparison of the selected checkout with its published contribution.
This refinement implements existing criteria 001.4 and 001.7 in
[remote contribution requirements](../requirements/remote-contribution-tasks.md).
The broader [contribution design](remote-contribution-tasks.md) retains branch
selection, source routing, confirmation, and backend lease ownership.
The [bounded timeline design](../../ui/system-design/bounded-changes-rendering.md)
owns row geometry independently of the comparison result.

The classifier implements this evidence gate for both desktop and phone.

## Evidence and classification

`useRemoteContributionRelation` selects repository/branch-scoped provider
evidence and ready Git status. `classifyRemoteContribution` consumes the
current provider head, complete authoritative provider commits, local head,
upstream head, and upstream-relative counts. Display-only retained provider
commits remain excluded from authorization.

The provider API and local remote-tracking ref are independent snapshots.
Counts against one upstream head cannot establish ancestry against a different
provider head. Base-relative counts never resolve that mismatch.

Evaluate evidence in this order:

| Evidence | Relation and presentation |
| --- | --- |
| No selected contribution | Existing ordinary repository behavior |
| Required current provider/Git evidence unavailable | Unknown, unified |
| Local head equals current provider head | Aligned, unified |
| Complete current provider history contains the unequal local head | Provider ahead, unified; existing configured-upstream Pull policy |
| Upstream head equals current provider head; ahead > 0 and behind = 0 | Local ahead, unified |
| Upstream head equals current provider head; ahead > 0 and behind > 0 | Confirmed divergence, separate |
| All other combinations | Unknown, unified |

The final case includes stale/unrelated upstream heads, absent upstream heads,
and inconsistent zero or one-sided counts that do not independently prove the
provider/local relationship. Missing a local SHA from a PR commit list alone
does not prove both histories contain unique commits.

Unknown must use the existing `unavailable_evidence` action policy. It must not
enable replacement/restoration or ordinary remote mutation from fallback counts.
Keep local files, commits, and retained published provenance usable. Genuine
divergence keeps local-first version groups and existing explicit confirmations.
Do not compare patch content, change Git refs, fetch automatically, or broaden
the supported provider surface.

## Desktop and phone

Both compositions share the same classifier and action policy. Uncertain
evidence uses the existing unified Commits section; confirmed divergence uses
Local checkout commits and PR version sections. The existing phone Changes
navigation and touch-accessible Git action surface remain the entry points.

## Validation and decisions

Pure classifier tests cover the evidence table, including stale upstream with
positive counts and zero-count inconsistency. Hook tests cover ready/pending
status and selected repository scope. Desktop and phone browser regressions
prove the rendered groups and absence of destructive choices for uncertainty,
then prove that matching two-sided evidence still exposes comparison.

This correction follows the ancestry rule in
[head drift ADR](../../../decisions/2026-08-10-remote-contribution-head-drift.md)
and the unavailable-evidence rule in
[provider enrichment ADR](../../../decisions/2026-08-13-provider-history-changes-enrichment.md).
It introduces no schema, persistence, or new architectural boundary.
