# Change workflow design

## Ownership and evidence

The task system owns this vertical capability, including its form and persistence.
`MoveTaskWithOptions` in `internal/task/service/service_workflow.go` already changes
workflow membership. The HTTP handler permits an active primary session. The
service still rejects other starting/running sessions and invalid workspaces.
This design preserves those checks; it does not require every session to be idle.

`Task.WorkflowAgentOverrides` stores one workflow ID and fixed-step bindings.
`normalizeWorkflowAgentOverrides` validates grouped input during creation.
`buildWorkflowAgentOverrideRows` derives grouped rows in the task-create form.
`PreviewWorkflowMove` predicts existing routing, and the move hook reconciles
committed versus failed moves. Extend these boundaries instead of creating a
second workflow transition engine.

## Requirement mapping

| Requirement | Sections |
| --- | --- |
| REQ-TASKS-CHANGE-WORKFLOW-001 | Shared form, Preview, Mobile contract, Failure handling |
| REQ-TASKS-CHANGE-WORKFLOW-002 | Request contract, Validation and persistence, Routing and compatibility |

## Request contract

Extend the existing HTTP move and move-preview request with an optional
`workflow_change` object. Proposed shape:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "destination-workflow",
  "workflow_step_id": "analysis-step",
  "position": 0,
  "workflow_change": {
    "expected_workflow_id": "source-workflow",
    "expected_step_id": "source-step",
    "expected_updated_at": "source-task-version",
    "agent_overrides": {"fixed-source-profile": "replacement-profile"}
  }
}
```

These are proposed fields, not existing APIs. The timestamp uses the task DTO's
RFC3339 representation and a typed timestamp comparison at the write boundary.
The existing position field retains its current server-owned placement semantics.

Absence or null retains the legacy move contract. A present object requires all
expected-source fields and an `agent_overrides` object; `{}` explicitly selects
destination defaults. Reject malformed or missing fields. A present object is
valid only for a different workflow in the same workspace, on a normal task.
Reject Office/ephemeral conversion and archived tasks. Office ownership is
identified by the task's `is_from_office` projection and by a non-empty
`project_id`; the service checks both so a project-owned Office task remains
excluded even when a caller's task projection is incomplete. Keep hidden
managed workflows out of the picker and reject them as explicit change
destinations.

Carry the typed option through `MoveTaskOptions`, HTTP, and the existing WS move
adapter. Both adapters must validate it consistently. MCP/plugin/bulk callers
omit it and retain their schemas and behavior. Do not use generic task updates
to edit this record. The frontend always sends the explicit object from this form.

Return existing move response fields, including entry identity and the task DTO.
Use a stable conflict code with HTTP 409 for a stale expected source/version.
Use structured validation codes and a source-profile ID for row errors. Localize
code-based messages in the client; do not display raw internal errors as new copy.

## Validation and persistence

Extract reusable validation from `workflow_agent_overrides.go` without constructing
a synthetic create request. Resolve the task's actual executor/profile and
workspace, rather than a new-task workspace default. Validate fixed source
membership, replacement visibility, enabled state, and executor compatibility.
Missing source definitions remain identifiable by ID so a valid replacement can
repair them. A fixed profile that remains selected as its default must also pass
eligibility checks. Explicit session targets are not fixed-profile sources.

Normalize once into destination step bindings using the existing model. Build a
candidate task copy with the destination workflow and new map for profile checks.
Retain the real source workflow/step and source session separately for exit policy.
Preflight must see the same candidate map that execution will read after commit.
Extend the existing preflight interface where it currently reloads the old task.
Never temporarily persist the candidate merely to run a preview or preflight.

Within the existing admission transaction, check expected workflow, step, and
task timestamp against the locked current row. Apply the candidate override map
in the same write as workflow membership, step admission/queue state, lifecycle
markers, and transition identity. Preserve the repository's workspace, step,
then task lock order. A new guarded admission option must not reuse the existing
step-CAS rebase blindly: that helper currently copies only a restricted field set
and would drop the replacement map and manual-move markers.

The existing nullable `tasks.workflow_agent_overrides` column is sufficient.
No new storage table or migration is planned. Audit both admitted and WIP-queued
write paths in `internal/task/repository/sqlite/task.go`; the shared repository
must retain SQLite/PostgreSQL SQL portability. Rejected CAS or transaction failure
must publish no successful move event. Extend repository tests with an injected
write failure and a write-time concurrent edit/move, not only a service pre-read.

After commit, existing task events carry the complete task projection. Routing,
future queued promotion, and restart load the new map. Never implement this as a
move followed by an independent override update.

## Open task workflow projection

The open task page must keep workflow membership, current step, and step
definitions in one destination-aware projection. `task.updated` already removes
a cross-workflow task from the source `kanban` cache and inserts it into the
destination `kanbanMulti` snapshot, creating a placeholder when necessary. The
page currently merges local task details with only `kanban.tasks`, and that
merge does not update `workflow_id`. After removal from the source cache, the
local details therefore retain the source workflow and the top bar continues
to read the source `kanban.steps` until a full page reload.

Resolve the open task's live placement from its task ID across the active and
multi-workflow snapshots. Use the owning snapshot's workflow ID together with
the task's step ID. A live placement newer than local task details supersedes
both fields; a partial task update that omits placement must preserve the known
fields. Do not use a source workflow row after the destination event has removed
it. Keep full task details for fields absent from board projections. A request
started before a newer live move must not restore the older placement.

The task page fetches the resolved workflow snapshot by ID, including when the
workflow is absent from the global workflow catalog and its destination
snapshot is only a placeholder. Fetch only the task's workflow; do not load all
workspace workflows solely for this page. The desktop stepper uses that
workflow's ordered steps and the freshness-resolved task step as current. Use a
cached projection step only when task details do not contain a step and the
cached step belongs to the resolved workflow. A newer task-detail response
remains authoritative over an older cached row, including for a move within the
same workflow. Keep the board's selected workflow unchanged. Reconnect and
foreground refresh converge the same projection after missed events. The phone
task action and list surfaces reuse the task placement state without a new
mobile stepper.

## Routing and compatibility

Use existing task-aware fixed-profile resolution. Initial and earlier-step
bindings stay authoritative. A replacement does not mutate an old session's
profile, override a `new` start policy, or create a missing prior-step binding.
Keep source retirement, workflow completion, WIP, and dependency gates intact.

The explicit change replaces the single stored map. Returning through this form
starts with destination defaults; previous maps are not restored. Disclose this
in the form. Legacy moves without `workflow_change` keep the existing dormant-map
behavior: leaving its workflow makes the map inactive, and returning can reactivate
it. This distinction avoids changing bulk, plugin, or MCP semantics silently.

Retain existing lifecycle markers and event ordering. A committed transition
whose agent launch subsequently fails remains a committed move with a visible
launch error. Do not undo membership or submit a second move automatically.
Existing entry-identity fencing owns stale completion and transition deduplication.
Tests must prove that an old source turn cannot advance the destination workflow.

## Preview

Extend `WorkflowMovePreviewRequest` and the handler's service validation path with
the normalized candidate map. `resolveWorkflowMovePreviewInput` must receive the
candidate destination choices while reading source policy from the original task.
Task reloads inside helper calls must not discard the candidate map.

The preview remains read-only and advisory under
[the existing preview contract](workflow-move-preview.md). Project actual reused
session models, expected new-session models, and unresolved recipients honestly.
Use the existing `dispatch`, `source_disposition`, context-reset, and notice fields.
Do not label skip-step-prompt as a guarantee that no session will start.

Extend `useWorkflowMovePreview` request, in-flight key, and invalidation inputs
with a canonical sorted mapping and expected source identity. Retain cancellation,
bounded concurrency, and late-response guards. Draft changes, routing changes,
and reconnect invalidate the preview. Unrelated activity must not cause a request
loop. Preview infrastructure failure remains nonblocking; authoritative data or
selection validation failures prevent submission.

## Shared form and entry points

Add a proposed `ChangeWorkflowDialog` and a domain hook for task-scoped draft state.
The hook owns loading, selectors, validation, preview, submit, and reconciliation.
Mount the surface outside the menu that triggers it, so closing the menu cannot
destroy its draft. Freeze the subject task ID when opening; changing active tabs
must not retarget a pending submission.

Replace single-task workflow submenus with one `Change workflow...` item in:

- `kanban-card-menu-items.tsx` and `kanban-card-menu.tsx`.
- `task-move-context-menu.tsx` and `task-switcher-context-menu-move-items.tsx`.
- `use-task-actions-menu.ts`, task action dialogs, and task management surfaces.
- `task-command-items.tsx` and `task-command-choices.tsx`.

Keep `Move to` for same-workflow steps. Bulk selection keeps its existing direct
move flow, labelled `Change workflow for selected tasks`; no grouped agent form
is implied. Keep action IDs/test IDs compatible where useful while updating tests
to the new visible flow. Internal identifiers do not need cosmetic renames.

Load destination details on selection even when no multi-board snapshot exists.
Use existing workflow/profile APIs and access checks. Do not treat an uncached
workflow as empty. Sort by workflow position and retain personally hidden steps.
Require a destination step rather than guessing from matching names or ordinals.

The form order is source summary, destination workflow, destination step,
Workflow agents, conversation relationships, entry preview, and actions.
Reuse or extract the create-form row derivation and profile picker. Do not import
the entire task-create form. Explain task-only scope and replacement of the old
map. Show defaults/reset explicitly. No fixed profiles means an informative
empty region after successful loading, not a hidden loading failure.

Existing one-shot move options may remain in a collapsed section, with their
current defaults. Mapping is not a one-shot option and never travels in the
pending one-shot marker. Reset-context remains off by default.

### Destination step colors

`AC-TASKS-CHANGE-WORKFLOW-001.9` uses the existing snapshot's
`WorkflowStepDTO.color`. `stepOptions` in
`apps/web/components/task/change-workflow-form-sections.tsx` currently places
this value directly in `style.backgroundColor`. Workflow settings persist
Tailwind tokens such as `bg-blue-500`, so those dots have no valid CSS background.
The dialog test fixture uses `#abcdef`, which does not exercise this failure.

Resolve each dot through `parseWorkflowStepColor` in
`apps/web/lib/task-color-presentation.ts`. Apply its static `className` for
supported tokens or its `style` for supported hex values. This reuses the existing
neutral fallback without a new color registry. The workflow editor's nine
`STEP_COLORS` values are represented exactly by this resolver. Other supported
aliases follow its existing palette normalization.

Retain `ComboboxOption.label` as the plain step name for search and accessibility.
The same `renderLabel` supplies options and the selected trigger; a separate
trigger renderer is unnecessary. Mark the dot decorative with `aria-hidden`
and retain its non-shrinking size beside truncated text. Keep workflow order,
selection reset, loading states, and shared domain state in their current owners.
No API, persistence, or translation changes are required.

The nearest phone color exemplar is
`apps/web/components/kanban/mobile-column-tabs.tsx`, which places a non-shrinking
colored dot beside a step label. Use the current Change workflow phone drawer
and combobox interaction without changing their composition or target sizes.
Focused desktop and phone Playwright checks must inspect computed background
colors in both option rows and the selected trigger; class presence alone does
not establish visible color. Component regressions cover class-token input,
custom hex input, neutral fallback, and reset to the placeholder.

## Mobile contract

Use `useResponsiveBreakpoint` for a phone form and wider dialog. The nearest
shipped exemplar is `components/kanban/mobile-menu-sheet.tsx`: an inset full-height
Drawer with fixed header and one internal scroll body. The task-create agent
override form supplies stacked labelled selectors and the responsive agent picker.

Phone entry is a visible task overflow action, not long press. This occasional
multi-field operation needs a full-height form because workflow mappings can be
long. A short nested menu or narrow table cannot show relationships and errors.
Use a fixed title/close header, vertically stacked fields, and a fixed bottom
`Change workflow` action above the safe area. The body owns vertical scrolling.
Use dynamic viewport units and no document horizontal overflow. Pickers own only
their temporary option-list scrolling and restore focus on close.

Desktop uses ordinary 28px controls. Phone/coarse-pointer hit targets are at least
44px; use 48px nominal primary-action sizing to tolerate fractional bounds.
Task state and mutations are shared; only presentation differs. Returning focus
targets the original trigger, or the nearest surviving task/board control after
the card leaves its source board. Do not change saved desktop preferences.

## Failure handling and observability

Validation failures retain the draft with row errors. Stale task conflicts reload
the task and require another explicit submit. If the task already moved elsewhere,
discard the stale source identity and explain the change. Revalidate retained
destination choices instead of silently overwriting the other operation.

On a transport timeout, refresh the task before retry. If its destination and
normalized map match, present the observed result without replaying entry effects.
Otherwise offer refresh/retry with the current source version. Disable duplicate
submit locally; the write-time source/version check protects repeated requests.

Reuse current structured move/route logs and transition history. Log profile IDs
only where existing routing diagnostics do; add no prompts, secrets, or new metric
labels. Board/source removal, destination insertion, sidebar, and open task stepper
must reconcile from the committed task using existing event/store paths.
