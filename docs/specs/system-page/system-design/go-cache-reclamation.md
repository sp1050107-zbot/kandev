# Go cache reclamation design

## Boundary

Use one selected shared `GOCACHE`, direct deletion, and an explicit busy-cleanup policy.
There are no cache generations, consumer records, or process-lifetime reconciliation.
The user accepts disrupted builds when busy cleanup is enabled.
The [decision](../../../decisions/2026-10-02-direct-go-cache-reclamation.md) records this tradeoff.

Preserve the [optional launch fallback](managed-go-cache-launch-fallback.md).
Do not alter execution environments, process supervision, or task retry behavior.

| Requirement | Design section |
| --- | --- |
| `REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-GO-CACHE-001` | Shared cache and build defaults |
| `REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-GO-CACHE-004` | Policy; Admission; Direct deletion |
| `REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-GO-CACHE-005` | Interface and reporting |

## Policy

Add the boolean `go_cache.allow_cleanup_while_busy` to
`GoCacheSettings` in `internal/system/storage/types.go` and matching web types.
Persist it in the existing settings JSON. Missing values resolve to false.
No new database table or runtime feature flag is needed.
Existing permissions protect writes. Existing settings save/reload and validation remain authoritative.

Use the existing schedule interval and `go_cache.max_bytes` threshold. Keep the displayed physical
cache size inclusive of the fuzz corpus, but report `cleanup_eligible_size_bytes` separately and
exclude fuzz-corpus bytes from threshold eligibility.
Do not add a parallel timer or change default schedule enablement.

| Trigger | Busy option off | Busy option on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduled, Go enabled and above threshold | Existing idle period and activity gate | Go runs despite activity and quiet period |
| Scheduled, schedule or Go disabled | No Go cleanup | No Go cleanup |
| Explicit Go cleanup above threshold | Existing manual activity gate; existing explicit force remains | Runs without another force prompt |
| Full manual run | Existing admission | Go can run; other providers retain their own existing admission |
| Any cleanup below threshold | No-op | No-op |

The saved option is persistent acceptance of build interruption, not a grant to
delete arbitrary paths. A snapshot controls a queued run; changing the setting
applies to subsequent runs. Display the snapshot policy in run details.

## Admission

Current `Operations.RunNow` calls global `preflight` before the runner starts.
Current `Runner.Run` returns early when global activity is busy. Both boundaries
must recognize the eligible Go-only phase; changing the provider alone cannot work.

When the option is enabled, partition the known Go provider from remaining
providers. Run Go under a shared storage-mutation mutex without the task activity
lease. Then attempt normal admission for remaining providers. Preserve completed
Go results if another provider is busy. Record skipped providers and busy reasons
rather than returning a whole-run `skipped_busy` result after deletion.

The shared mutex belongs to the storage composition and is passed to scheduled
and manual runners, even though Operations constructs a new Runner for each job.
It also serializes direct cleanup with adoption and Go quarantine restore/delete.
An existing process-local lock can be extended; do not add per-consumer persistence.
Preserve single-install ownership and existing shutdown/restore/reset cancellation.

Do not implement this by calling `TryAcquireMaintenanceForce` for a scheduled full
run. That grants the wrong scope and new task admission still cancels its lease.
The opted-in Go phase must not be cancelled by `activity.Coordinator.AcquireTask`.
It remains cancellable on service shutdown, operation cancellation, or its deadline.
Keep the current coordinator unchanged for normal task work and other providers.

With the option off, retain the existing idle/preemption behavior. Existing manual
force is a one-run choice; the new setting does not broaden that choice's scope.
A new task is permitted to overlap opted-in deletion. No task is stopped or retried automatically.

## Direct deletion

Replace `gocache.Provider`'s quarantine rotation with deletion of build-cache contents.
Keep the selected root and its ownership marker. Existing executions keep the same
absolute path, and Go can recreate cache entries on subsequent commands.
Do not rename the root, create a replacement generation, or move bytes into trash.

Retain ownership/adoption and exact-root validation. Use the repository's
handle-relative directory safety patterns so path replacement cannot redirect deletion.
Do not follow symlinks, junctions, or nested mounts. Preserve an unexpected entry
and report a partial result when containment cannot be established.
Preserve the Kandev marker and root `fuzz` subtree. The physical measurement includes its bytes,
but cleanup-eligible size and threshold discovery exclude that subtree.
Never erase a parent directory or an unadopted default cache.

Use a bounded traversal with a 30-second operation deadline, batches of at most
1,000 entries, and a maximum of 100,000 examined entries per pass. These are internal
limits, not new settings. Check cancellation between batches. Retain an in-memory
directory cursor and accumulated size across calls for the same cache root and
threshold. Do not delete any build data until accumulated measurement proves the
threshold is exceeded. Once exceeded, delete saved candidates and continue bounded
deletion in later calls. Do not restart the scan repeatedly to catch concurrent
writes. Mark budget-exhausted passes partial. A backend restart or changed cache
root, ownership mode, threshold, or mount identity may discard the cursor and
start a fresh scan.

Compare mount identity as well as filesystem/device identity at traversal and
removal boundaries. Linux uses mount IDs, macOS uses the mounted-on path, and
Windows uses the resolved volume mount path. Unsupported platforms or unavailable
mount identity fail closed. Preserve and report nested mounts, including bind
mounts that share the cache root's device.

Successful deletion can overlap new writes. New entries can remain, and a build
can fail when an expected file disappears. Both are accepted in busy mode.
Missing entries during traversal are benign; permission or identity failures are
partial failures. Avoid an unbounded `os.RemoveAll` or shell `go clean` call.

Revalidate root identity at each mutation boundary. The storage mutex prevents
Kandev settings/adoption/restore races; directory handles protect against external
path replacement. At completion, preserve a usable owned root for subsequent builds.
If the root was externally replaced, stop and do not recreate through the replacement.

Count removed logical bytes only for successful unlink operations. Do not infer
removed bytes from before-minus-after while writers are active. A bounded final
measurement can report remaining bytes or incomplete status. Open files and
sparse files mean these bytes are not an exact filesystem-free-space delta.

No quarantine intent means no retention delay and no `active_quarantine` blocker.
Historical quarantine records still use their old controller and retention rules.
Preserve historical result decoding and keep `quarantine_entry: null` in new results.

## Compatibility

The current managed root and explicitly adopted root remain valid selections.
The new busy policy applies to either after existing ownership checks. For an
adopted path, the warning includes builds outside Kandev that share that cache.
The default user cache remains read-only unless the operator explicitly adopted it.
Container and remote executors retain their existing local cache behavior.

Disabling management stops new managed overrides but does not erase data.
Explicit Go cleanup remains available under the existing resource-selection contract.
Existing quarantine contents remain restorable until their recorded deletion conditions apply.
No historical retention deadline is shortened and no other provider's policy changes.

## Shared cache and build defaults

Keep existing shared `GOCACHE` injection and fallback.
[PR #4160](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/4160) merged at
`341f8941376e29f21b0873ae94a989cf2a595c58`. Repository-owned build and test
commands pass `-trimpath` directly. Backend Make targets retain caller-supplied
`GOFLAGS`; backend CI sets `GOFLAGS=-trimpath` for direct Go commands. Root Make
targets delegate to the backend recipes, and the reuse probe checks both paths.
The implementation fixes path-dependent fixtures and exercises two source
directories with one cache, matching package inputs, and source invalidation.
Build and test reuse is checked through artifacts and build IDs, not elapsed time.
No host-global `go env -w` setting or flags for unrelated repositories are used.

Go's own normal age-based pruning remains active. This feature supplements it;
it does not enforce a quota or replace the cache format.

## Interface and reporting

Add the switch to the existing Go policy card, below the size threshold.
Default it off. Show its warning visibly next to the control, not only in help.
Saving the switch is sufficient; do not add a typed confirmation or repeated prompt.
The switch can be saved even when automatic scheduling is disabled because it
also applies to explicit cleanup. Explain the remaining schedule requirements.

Update schedule help to state that opted-in Go cleanup is exempt from idle checks.
Explain direct deletion and build retries. Keep the threshold unit convention.
Use the existing expanded Go row, cleanup action, and run history. No new page,
consumer count, generation display, or retained-generation metric is needed.

Extend results additively with removed bytes, remaining measurement status,
partial/error details, and whether busy cleanup was permitted. Keep historical JSON
readable. In mixed runs, show that Go completed and other providers were skipped.
Use bounded reason codes and existing localized rendering. Preserve administrator gating.

Desktop uses the current SettingRow with its switch. Phone uses the existing
stacked card composition and page scroll owner. Wrap warning text, preserve touch
help and at least 44-pixel phone targets, and do not enlarge desktop controls.
The nearest exemplar is the existing Storage policy card and storage-setting-help.
Localize all new copy in seven languages and regenerate Traditional Chinese.

## Verification

The completed [implementation package](../../../plans/go-cache-reclamation/plan.md)
defines four sequential work orders. Tests prove opted-in deletion occurs during
active task work, not merely that an API returns success. Also prove the off
setting blocks cleanup, another provider stays protected, and ownership checks
still reject a malicious path. Do not require an active build to succeed in busy mode.

Public operations documentation describes the shipped behavior. Implementation
changes do not alter live settings or storage during development.
