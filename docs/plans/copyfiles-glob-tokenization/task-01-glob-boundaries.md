# Task 01: Repair Glob Boundaries

## Summary

Make list tokenization honor character classes and native escape semantics.
Recreate permanent regressions and verify local/remote selection parity.

## In scope

- Tokenizer state, focused parsing and Copy/Plan tests, public grammar guidance.
- Preserve save validation and existing suffix/mode/precedence semantics.

## Out of scope

- Consumers, settings schema/UI, containment policy, and unrelated cleanup.

## Acceptance

- Permanent tests fail before the fix for class commas, class braces, and POSIX
  escaped braces; after the fix both public materializers select all expected
  paths and bytes without warnings.
- Grammar tests preserve escapes, negation, nesting, adjacent suffixes, and
  first-entry precedence; Windows separators do not escape syntax.
- Exact targeted checks pass and the plan records their results.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./internal/worktree/copyfiles)
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
python3 .github/scripts/backend-tests-workflow-contract_test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning_test.py
git diff --check
```

Run focused failing tests first with `go test ./internal/worktree/copyfiles
-run 'Test(ParseSpecs|CopyPlan)_GlobTokenization' -count=1` from `apps/backend`.
Native Windows coverage runs in the existing CI `test-windows` job:

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race -v ./internal/worktree/copyfiles -run '^(TestParseSpecs_GlobTokenization|TestParseSpecs_NativeEscapes|TestCopyPlan_GlobTokenization|TestCopyPlan_UnclosedClassKeepsFollowingEntries|TestValidateSpec_GlobAdjacentSuffix)$')
```

When bare Node is absent, resolve the configured runtime through
`pnpm exec node -p process.execPath` from `apps/`, then invoke that executable
from repo root; validators resolve repository files against the working directory.

Run the repository PR documentation `validateCoverage` preflight against changed
files and the full referenced artifact closure before publication. If a PR
finding requires backend edits, run the scoped AGENTS.md lint command too.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/worktree/copyfiles/copyfiles.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/worktree/copyfiles/copyfiles_glob_tokenization_test.go`
- `docs/public/git-operations.md`
- `.github/workflows/backend-tests.yml` (focused Windows native test step).
- The paired specs and this unique plan package for status/results.

## Dependencies

None. A later explicit implementation turn follows the design handoff.

## Risks

Native backslash semantics and class closing delimiters; avoid rewriting bytes
that the matcher needs. Keep test fixtures portable and use POSIX-only skips
only for genuine platform-specific patterns or native links.

## Parallelism

`sequential`; no workers or extra persistent tasks/sessions.

## Inputs

- Paired requirement/design above and ADR 0010.
- `copyfiles.go`, `copyfiles_test.go`, `copyfiles_symlink_test.go`.
- `.agents/skills/tdd/references/backend-tests.md`.

## Results

- Permanent focused regressions failed before the production edit for the
  reported class comma, class brace, and escaped brace; additional delimiter,
  mode/precedence, and suffix validation assertions also failed as expected.
- Focused grammar/Copy/Plan tests pass after the correction.
- `go test -race ./internal/worktree/copyfiles`: passed.
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed (339 decisions, 1283 specs).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: passed (36 tests).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- Public docs validator tests: passed (62 tests), using Node v24.18.0 from root.
- Live public docs validator: passed (47 pages), using Node v24.18.0 from root.
- Backend workflow contract: passed (10 tests); action pinning: passed (9 tests).
- Repository `validateCoverage` preflight: covered, no errors.
- Normal commit hooks: passed, including package Go lint and commitlint; no bypass.
- `git diff --check`: passed after removing an extra trailing documentation blank line.
- Native Windows grammar execution is delegated to the focused existing CI job;
  local verification ran on Linux. No live instance/data used.

The first public-doc test invocation from `apps/` failed on a root-relative
plugin-doc path. Running the same tests from repository root passed; no validator
or unrelated document was changed.

## PR review remediation

Codex and Greptile identified the same unclosed-class regression; CodeRabbit
identified exact escaped-comma matching missing the dependency's literal fast
path. Permanent tests reproduced both failures at `f01002fa8` before remediation.
Restore independent entries for an unclosed class and add an exact-literal escape
fallback after native literal priority. Both corrections stay in copyfiles with
unchanged validation policy and containment. Final remediation results:

- Focused RED tests reproduced both reviewer findings before the correction.
- Full `go test -race ./internal/worktree/copyfiles`: passed after the final edit.
- Full backend `golangci-lint run ./... --new-from-rev=08e4ffdb99caf40b0df5baa67b29cf4313188f15 --timeout=5m`: passed, zero issues, with `GOMAXPROCS=2`.
  The first cold-cache run reported zero issues but timed out; a warmed-cache
  retry of the same command passed without bypass.
- Catalog validation, 36 spec-linter tests, full spec lint: passed.
- Public validator tests (62), live public validator (47 pages): passed.
- Backend workflow contract (10), action pinning (9): passed.
- Documentation coverage preflight: covered, no errors.
- Diff whitespace checks: passed.
- Native exact-path priority is covered with distinct escaped and literal files.
  Malformed-class recovery verifies the following entry survives with one warning.

## Native CI correction

Native Windows run `36910633806`, job `110538457789`, passed every focused case
except the stale Windows expectation for an unclosed class after a native
separator. Its actual three entries match the malformed-class recovery contract;
update the expectation only. Production code remains unchanged. Rebased onto
`daab1c45647e7ac9e002f15e02f6e910a3e778a4`; package race tests, catalog validation,
full spec lint and 36 linter tests, 62 public-validator tests and 47-page live
validation, and 10 backend workflow-contract tests passed again. Native CI will
verify the corrected assertion before merge.

## Windows CI evidence correction

Windows job `110743714815` and its original attempt both reached the existing
40-minute job cap before the focused copyfiles step. The last command was the
unchanged Windows-sensitive package suite; buffered output exposed no assertion
or proof of compilation-only delay. Current-main job `110746572298` passed the
same command and limits. Move copyfiles coverage immediately after Go setup and
enable streaming JSON for the existing suite while preserving `-race`, `-v`,
`-timeout 25m`, every package, the job cap, and native shell exit propagation.
This change supplies native evidence and bounded diagnostics; it does not claim
the unexplained slowness is fixed. Only focused workflow/specification checks and
normal hooks are required locally; unchanged Go suites await hosted execution.
Post-edit workflow contract (10 tests), action pinning (9 tests), catalog
validation (339 decisions, 1283 specifications), full specification lint, and
diff whitespace checks passed. Normal hooks and final native CI remain pending.
