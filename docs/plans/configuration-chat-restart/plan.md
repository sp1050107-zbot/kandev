# Implementation Plan: Configuration Chat Restart

## Overview

Add an explicit replacement action to the floating Configuration Chat header.
Implement the stop/delete/start backend contract first, then connect the shared
client lifecycle and responsive header. Both work orders were implemented
sequentially with TDD in the primary session after the implementation request.

The [requirements](../../specs/tasks/requirements/configuration-chat-restart.md)
and [system design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/configuration-chat-restart.md)
own behavior and technical boundaries. The existing
[Quick Chat resume package](../quick-chat-session-resume/plan.md) remains complete;
this package adds explicit replacement without reopening its historical work.

## Scope

In scope: the Configuration Chat header, confirmation, strict old-agent stop,
canonical deletion, blank replacement, errors, shared-state reconciliation,
localization, desktop/mobile coverage, and public recovery guidance.

Out of scope: ordinary chats/tasks, rollback of configuration changes, an
expanded-dialog restart button, a second conversation store, global cleanup
changes, and provider-specific restart implementations.

## Technical approach

- New `httpRestartConfigChat` and a narrow orchestrator retirement boundary
  compose existing task authorization, deletion preview, synchronous stop,
  `DeleteTaskWithLifecycle`, and `LaunchSession`.
- The existing quick-chat list projects transient restart admission; competing
  configuration creation is blocked until settlement, including after response
  loss or a browser reload. No persistent operation ledger is introduced.
- Add a typed restart API call; extend `useConfigChat`'s shared admission and
  registration without treating accepted restarts as abandoned setup starts.
- Extract the header and confirmation as needed; keep all state/error behavior
  above the conditional session/setup body.
- Preserve profile and executor selection; map restart errors to localized
  recovery actions. Scope all asynchronous results to their captured identities.

| Runtime shape | Restart behavior | Evidence / fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACP profile | Blank config-mode task/session, explicit start, no prompt replay | Backend ordering and hook tests; browser sends a new prompt |
| CLI passthrough | Same replacement lifecycle; one explicit terminal launch | Backend/hook tests and passthrough browser case |
| Stopped or failed agent | Inspect runtime ownership; confirmed absence allows replacement | Missing-runtime and stale-runtime backend tests |
| Unavailable profile/executor or uncertain remote stop | Preserve old conversation and show error | Preflight/stop failure tests; no silent provider switch |

## ASCII UI preview

### UI-01: Panel header, persisted conversation

```text
Desktop
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration Chat      [Restart] [Expand] [Close] |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Existing conversation                             |
|                                                   |
+----------------------------------------------------+

Phone (same panel, touch-sized controls)
+----------------------------------------+
| Configuration...   [R] [Expand] [Close] |
+----------------------------------------+
| Conversation owns the scroll region    |
+----------------------------------------+
```

R is the restart icon with accessible name Restart session, not literal UI
copy. Header remains fixed. Desktop controls measure 28px; phone/coarse-pointer
controls measure at least 44px in both dimensions. Setup shows Restart disabled.

### UI-02: Confirmation and restart feedback

```text
Desktop anchored confirmation       Phone inset bottom confirmation
+------------------------------+   +----------------------------------+
| Restart session?             |   | Restart session?                 |
| Delete this conversation and |   | Delete this conversation and     |
| start a new one.             |   | start a new one.                 |
| [Cancel]   [Restart session] |   | [Cancel]       [Restart session] |
+------------------------------+   +----------------------------------+

Panel during restart              Panel after startup failure
+------------------------------+  +----------------------------------+
| Configuration Chat [R:busy] X |  | Configuration Chat [R] ...       |
| Restarting session...        |  | Previous conversation cleared.   |
|                              |  | New session could not start.     |
|                              |  | [Retry starting session]         |
+------------------------------+  +----------------------------------+
```

Control order, header placement, confirmation consequence, separate status,
and usable phone hitboxes are structural requirements (AC .1, .2, .6-.9).
Spacing and prose are illustrative; final copy is localized. Close stays
available during accepted work and never cancels the backend operation. Expand
and sending remain disabled until settlement. A pre-deletion failure instead
keeps the old conversation with its error and Retry restart action.

## Tests

| Acceptance | Planned evidence |
| --- | --- |
| .3-.7 | `config_chat_restart_test.go`: `TestConfigChatRestart` subtests for authorization, lifecycle exclusion, ordering, absence, duplication, and each failure stage |
| .3-.6 | `config_chat_restart_test.go` in handlers: `TestHTTPRestartConfigChat` request/ticket/response tests |
| .4, .6-.8 | `workspace-api.test.ts`, `use-config-chat.test.ts`, `use-quick-chat-resync.test.ts`, `quick-chat-sync.test.ts`: deferred restart, no replay, failure reconciliation, cross-hook admission and workspace/close races |
| .1-.2, .5-.9 | New `config-chat-panel.test.tsx`: disabled/confirm/cancel, mounted-session errors, progress and focus |

Test titles in the implementation must identify these scenarios; add AC
annotations where their mapping is not clear. Existing creation/resumption
tests are focused regression coverage, not evidence of restart implementation.

## E2E tests

- `settings/config-chat-restart.spec.ts`, project `chromium`: running and broken
  session replacement, cancel, failure/retry, new prompt, expansion, reload,
  and passthrough creation (AC .1-.8).
- `settings/mobile-config-chat-restart.spec.ts`, project `mobile-chrome`: same
  recovery value through the phone confirmation, busy/error reachability,
  focus return, header hitboxes, containment and no horizontal overflow (AC
  .1-.2, .5-.9).
- Include a narrow fine-pointer case and 767/768px boundary assertions in the
  desktop spec for the responsive header. Run existing desktop and mobile
  Configuration Chat specs alongside the new cases.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Backend replacement operation](task-01-backend-restart.md)
- [x] [Task 02: Header recovery flow](task-02-header-recovery.md)

Task 02 depended on Task 01. Both work orders are complete.
Execution was sequential in the primary session.

## Verification results

Design checks completed on 2026-09-29:

- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed (330 decisions, 1248 specs).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: passed (36 tests).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `git diff --check -- docs/specs docs/plans/configuration-chat-restart`: passed;
  an explicit new-file whitespace and relative-link check also passed.
- `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs` `validateCoverage`, run with the installed
  Node 24 binary: actual docs-only changes are exempt; preflight against the
  planned panel change validates both work orders, requirement/AC definitions,
  design references, and manifest backlinks.
- `git status --short -- docs/specs docs/plans/configuration-chat-restart`:
  five new documentation files, unstaged and uncommitted.

Implementation checks completed on 2026-10-01:

- All 16 discovered backend restart test functions and their subtests passed
  with the race detector. Existing config-chat, quick-chat listing, empty-prompt
  and config-context startup regression suites passed. Scoped Go lint: zero issues.
- Eight focused frontend test files passed (123 tests). Type checking, scoped
  ESLint, locale completeness, generated catalogs and the new-copy ratchet passed.
- Fresh managed browser runs passed sequentially with one worker: 12 desktop
  tests and four phone tests, including the existing Configuration Chat flows.
  Both restart flows assert no conversation messages before the first new prompt.
- UI-01/UI-02 were checked against rendered desktop and phone screenshots.
  Phone controls and confirmation actions meet the 44px minimum, the drawer
  stays inside the viewport, and Cancel returns focus without losing a draft.
- Public documentation was updated. All 62 public-document validator tests
  passed and 47 published pages validated. The documentation catalog,
  specification lint, 36 specification-linter tests, delivery-package coverage,
  tracked diff whitespace and all 20 new files' whitespace checks passed.

The first final phone build encountered missing shared Go-cache files; a retry
with an isolated cache completed the backend but the host killed the frontend
build (exit 137). The successful fresh phone run used that isolated cache and
`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048`. These build failures occurred before
browser tests started. Exact test commands and RED/GREEN evidence are recorded
in the work orders. Changes remain uncommitted.

## Risks

- Normal deletion and stop responses permit background teardown; using them
  directly would not prove the required stop-before-replacement ordering.
- Stop can invalidate a deletion preview. Consume the ticket before stop and
  keep the subsequent deletion in the same accepted backend operation.
- Workspace changes, the setup `reset()` cleanup, or a late deletion event can
  discard a valid replacement unless identity and operation state stay separate.
- Runtime stop/start can fail independently. The frontend must distinguish an
  intact old conversation, cleared conversation, and retained failed replacement.
- Session lifecycle/cancellation lock ordering must be covered by deferred
  stop/resume tests rather than holding a broad lock across arbitrary callbacks.

## Delivery validation (2026-10-03)

The publication branch was integrated with the current base. The AppState
resolution retains its canonical task-overview slice and the restart actions;
Quick Chat keeps the base's failure-aware auto-resume and tombstone behavior.
The frontend guidance stays within 300 lines. Restart copy now covers Korean,
which became a supported locale after the original implementation.

- Backend restart race tests and the listed handler/startup regression commands
  passed again. Scoped Go lint against the current base reported zero issues.
- The eight listed frontend suites passed again (131 tests, including the
  additional baseline recovery cases). Type checking, i18n completeness and the
  new-copy ratchet passed for every supported locale.
- Fresh managed desktop 12/12 and phone 4/4 browser checks passed sequentially
  with one worker and a 2048MB Node heap. Fresh publication screenshots cover
  the desktop confirmation, phone drawer and recovered phone conversation.
- Harness checks (19 tests and all 200 files), specification/catalog validation
  (343 decisions and 1323 specs), and public-doc checks (62 tests and 47 pages)
  passed after integration. The normal commit hooks ran without bypass.

The earlier implementation evidence remains historical. This delivery run
supersedes it for PR validation and screenshot publication. CI and automated
reviews own the remaining publication gate; no remote merge is claimed here.

## Review remediation (2026-10-03)

All 14 review threads and the aggregate review findings were inspected against
current source. Changes cover blank startup turn ownership, strict request
framing, provider admission, workspace-scoped list generations, HTTP failure
classification, bounded recovery after preparation deadlines, workspace-specific
client errors, independent bounded chat resync, and expanded-view status refresh.
Localized recovery copy, supported-locale design coverage and causal browser
waits were reconciled with the final behavior.

Backend race checks passed for 25 discovered test functions plus subtests across
three packages; handler/startup regressions and current-base Go lint passed.
The eight frontend suites passed 136 tests, and type, lint and locale checks
passed. Fresh desktop 13/13 and fresh phone restart/popover 3/3 passed; all five
listed phone cases passed again against those built artifacts. Work orders record
commands and regression evidence. Final committed-source captures, hooked commit,
new exact-head CI, thread dispositions and remote merge remain delivery gates.
