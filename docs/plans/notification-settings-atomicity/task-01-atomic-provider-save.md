# Task 01: Save Notification Provider Configuration Atomically

## Summary

Prove the rejected-save defect using the real SQLite store, then make provider
fields and subscriptions commit together. Preserve defaults, event omission,
explicit empty events, and tenant ownership through the actual backend boundaries.

## In scope

- Pre-write input validation; atomic create/update repository operations and shared
  SQL helpers; default Local/System provider creation.
- Permanent invalid-input and injected subscription-failure regressions for create
  and update, plus successful saves and omission/empty/ownership checks.
- Update notification repository test doubles for the atomic interface.
- Minimal public notification documentation explaining failed-save preservation
  in `docs/public/developer-tools.md` (how-to section).

## Out of scope

Schema changes, UI changes, delivery behavior, cross-request batch atomicity,
new authentication boundaries, unrelated refactors, and additional workers/tasks.

## Acceptance

1. Validation failure or a confirmed persistence abort preserves provider fields,
   timestamps, and all subscription rows; an aborted create leaves neither provider
   nor subscriptions. Ambiguous commit errors require saved-state reconciliation. The new
   regressions fail on main for the confirmed cause before implementation.
2. Successful create/update atomically persist the selected configuration, omitted
   updates preserve subscriptions, and explicit empty updates clear them. Default
   creation can retry after a subscription failure without skipping an orphan row.
3. Foreign/missing update fails before subscription mutation; targeted tests and
   persistence/documentation checks pass, with exact results recorded here.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./internal/notifications/service ./internal/notifications/store ./internal/notifications/controller)
(cd apps/backend && go run ./cmd/sqlguard ./internal)
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./internal/persistence/storeconformance -count=1)
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
git diff --check
```

Run the new failing regressions alone before the production correction, recording
the expected mismatch. PostgreSQL behavior coverage is environment-gated on
`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`; report availability explicitly. Do not overlap broad
suites; preserve every running command handle until completion.

## Dependencies and parallelism

None. Sequential in this isolated workspace; preserve other work and refresh main.

## Inputs

- [Notification requirements](../../specs/platform/requirements/notifications.md).
- [Atomicity design](../../specs/platform/system-design/notification-settings-atomicity.md).
- Supplied investigation evidence: `invalid_events` and `subscription_write`
  changed the durable provider while returning errors on isolated SQLite.
- Existing controller event defaulting and service/store ownership tests.

## Risks

Nil/empty selection semantics, transaction ownership predicates, dialect rebinding,
and test fixture isolation. No unresolved material product choice.

## Results

Implemented atomic create/update and default-provider bootstrap with shared
transaction SQL helpers. All input validation precedes service writes. Permanent
SQLite regressions failed before correction on invalid-event update, subscription
write create/update, and Local/System bootstrap; the saved fields/timestamp changed
or orphan provider rows remained. The corrected regressions pass.

- `go test -race ./internal/notifications/service ./internal/notifications/store ./internal/notifications/controller`: passed all three packages after final test refactor.
- `go run ./cmd/sqlguard ./internal`: passed.
- `go test -race ./internal/persistence/storeconformance -count=1`: passed.
- `go test -v -run TestPostgresRepositoryAtomicProviderSave ./internal/notifications/store`: passed with the PostgreSQL test skipped. `KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` was unavailable; permanent isolated PostgreSQL coverage is included for rollback, ownership, successful saves, omission, and empty selection.
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed (339 decisions, 1282 specifications at design checkpoint).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs`: 62 passed.
- `node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs`: 47 pages validated.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Repository documentation coverage preflight: covered, no errors.

Public docs updated in the existing Apprise notification how-to section. No UI
files changed, so browser screenshots and mobile layout checks are not required.
Node/pnpm resolved through the installed mise runtime; frozen workspace install
completed for normal commit hooks.

Local implementation is done. PR publication and exact-head CI/review/merge
remain externally pending. Commit/push and open a focused PR using local guidance;
remediate CI and all review threads, confirm exact-head checks and trusted semantic
reviews, and use normal merge/queue under existing authorization. Report the PR and
merged SHA to parent `14825981-b175-411d-999a-31ddc2aa5fc3`; do not declare completion
before merge or a concrete external blocker.


## PR review remediation

Valid review findings addressed: each store scenario creates its own provider and
snapshot; the unused complete-update parameter is removed; service event selection
asserts set membership rather than unspecified timestamp-tie order; rollback tests
verify the subscription UNIQUE constraint error from the second insert for SQLite
and PostgreSQL. These are test-only coverage improvements of existing behavior.
Documentation qualifies confirmed rollback versus an ambiguous PostgreSQL commit
acknowledgement; whole-configuration atomicity remains the same.

Rebased onto main `daab1c45647e7ac9e002f15e02f6e910a3e778a4` before the resource
hold, without owned-file conflicts. Post-remediation targeted race tests passed for
service, store, and controller. Specification catalog/lint and public-doc validators
passed (62 tests; 47 pages). The CI-style lint attempt was blocked by another
task's shared lint lock, so it did not provide lint evidence. Normal commit hooks
and focused tests are required for the release fixup. Compatibility with the later
main is checked through an isolated synthetic merge, without routine rebasing.
Release fixup: `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOFLAGS=-p=2 go test -race -run
'TestNotificationSuccessfulSaveAndEventSelection|TestSQLiteRepositoryAtomicProviderSave|TestPostgresRepositoryAtomicProviderSave'
./internal/notifications/service ./internal/notifications/store` passed. PostgreSQL
remains environment-gated and unavailable locally. Fresh exact-head CI/reviews and
merge remain pending.
