# Implementation plan: Plain Git comparison output

## Overview

Deliver one sequential repair of the two machine-parsed comparison producers.
The parent supplied real-Git evidence at actual main
`678a4d19ad5ffd8f6f9c5f7be419bbdc02609d24`: after committing a README update
and `added.txt`, both `ShowCommit` and `GetCumulativeDiff` returned two files
with color disabled and zero files with `color.ui=always` and
`color.diff=always`. Both incorrectly reported success. The accepted proof is
`/tmp/kandev-forced-color-diff-repro.go`; parent handle 71977 joined with exit 1
and package time 0.093s. The temporary test was removed and the parent root was
clean. The earlier malformed `-p1` command was setup failure, not evidence.
Do not replay that proof before permanent RED tests.

Root cause: the patch commands omit an explicit plain-output flag. Forced color
prefixes section headers with escape sequences, while `splitDiffSections`
requires `diff --git ` at column zero. The prior metadata repair remains valid;
this repair prevents display decoration from hiding sections at the producer.

## Scope

### In scope

- Add `--no-color` to the patch-producing `ShowCommit` and `GetCumulativeDiff`
  invocations in `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/process/git_log.go`.
- ONLY exact `--no-color` admission in `common/securityutil/git.go`, with focused
  allow and malformed/value/suffixed rejection tests in existing `git_test.go`.
- Permanent real-Git process and registered-HTTP regression tests in two new
  bounded test files, using existing fixture and environment seams.
- Extend the existing owning Platform requirement/design and this one order.
- Preserve exact paths, literal content bytes, status/count/metadata fidelity,
  binary/root/merge/empty semantics, budgets/limits, read-only behavior and routing.

### Out of scope

Parser rewrites, ANSI stripping, configuration mutation, shared subprocess color
policy, tracker changes, operator-environment refactoring, broader Git cleanup,
new APIs/dependencies, frontend/browser/build/layout/copy work and new ADRs.
Report an actual additional comparison producer to the parent before expanding.

## Technical approach

Follow the [owning design](../../specs/platform/system-design/git-diff-file-metadata.md#plain-comparison-output).
The two patch argv lists change, with one exact safe-flag registration in
`apps/backend/internal/common/securityutil/git.go`. Reject malformed, value and
suffixed variants through focused tests in its existing `git_test.go`. Keep the metadata-only `git show` query,
validation, operator environment provider, `RunGitAfterAcquire`, admission class,
timeouts, cancellation and managed subprocess ownership intact.

Immediate inventory: `parseCommitDiff`/`parseCommitDiffWithOptions` have these
two production comparison callers. Registered commit HTTP uses `ShowCommit`;
all resolved cumulative paths use `GetCumulativeDiff`. Client and WS projections
forward existing result fields. No additional producer requiring expansion was
found in this inventory. `GetLog` shortstat and mutation `ShowCommitStats` are
separate operations and not part of this patch-parser contract.

| Surface | Identity and expected result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local commit | Requested SHA; first-parent/root semantics; uncapped patch and metadata | Real `ShowCommit` regressions |
| Local cumulative | Existing base-to-worktree comparison including dirty tracked content | Real `GetCumulativeDiff` regressions and existing caps |
| Registered commit / selected cumulative HTTP | Selected repository only, exact path and plain content | Real registered-router tests |
| Aggregate cumulative HTTP | Independent repo bases, NUL-qualified identical paths, distinct sentinels and repository metadata | Two-repository registered-router test |
| Existing client / WS projections | Same field/status shapes pass through | Producer and HTTP evidence; no projection changes |
| Provider-only history / live tracker | Existing independent source contract | No changes or claimed new coverage |

## Tests

| Criteria | Test and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| .1, .2, .3, .6 | `TestGitComparisonPlainOutput` in process `git_log_plain_output_test.go`: unset defaults, UI always alone, UI false plus diff always, both always, UI always plus diff false; explicit file keys/status/counts/metadata and exact plain patch oracle |
| .3, .6, .7 | Same test includes literal ANSI source content, an escape-containing path on filesystems that support it, binary modification and empty-file addition/deletion controls, plus dirty cumulative reads; compare config/HEAD/refs/index/status/content before and after each read |
| .5, .6 | `TestGitComparisonPlainOutputRootAndEmpty` and `TestGitComparisonPlainOutputMerge` in the same process file: forced color through the distinct root/empty/first-parent branches |
| .4 | Existing `TestGetCumulativeDiff_TruncatesLargeFile`, `_BudgetExceeded`, `_CapsFileCount`, `TestShowCommit_NotCapped`, and parser status-budget tests; keep budgets and skip reasons intact |
| .3, .6, .7 | `TestGitComparisonPlainOutputHTTP` and `TestGitComparisonPlainOutputMultiRepoHTTP` in API `git_plain_output_test.go`: actual router, selected/aggregate identity and per-repo bytes, counts and status, read-only snapshots |

Use explicit expected values and a raw `git ... --no-color` patch oracle, not
argv-only assertions or comparisons between two potentially empty results.
No blanket assertion that every ESC is absent: literal ANSI is legitimate data.
Isolate fixture Git configuration with the existing test/environment seams
before operator or manager creation. Do not patch process environment after a
manager snapshot or run environment-changing tests in parallel. Keep portable
tests on Windows; scope only unsupported filesystem names, if demonstrated.

Focused securityutil evidence: `TestIsKnownSafeGitFlagAllowsNoColor` and
`TestIsKnownSafeGitFlagRejectsNoColorVariants` prove exact flag admission and
rejection of malformed/value/suffixed forms. The order includes that package
in scoped race and lint commands.

## End-to-end and surface assessment

Real Git -> operator -> registered router -> decoded JSON is the end-to-end
boundary. This is source-data normalization with no layout, touch, scrolling,
navigation or viewport changes. The mobile-parity pure-data exception applies;
no browser, E2E shard or ASCII UI preview is required. Public-docs assessment:
the existing Git operations reference already states faithful read-only
comparisons; this repair adds no user option, API field or workflow. No public
documentation change is needed.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Produce plain comparison patches](task-01-produce-plain-comparisons.md)

## Delivery gates

The design turn ended with four unstaged/uncommitted artifacts and a queued
handoff to parent `14825981-b175-411d-999a-31ddc2aa5fc3`. The later explicit
parent INTERRUPT released implementation in task
`2d3cd45e-8d4e-4996-91d3-14bdeaa88a5f`, session
`fccd06a9-126d-45e1-ab32-13504ff36364`. That handoff gate is complete. No
operator approval/model-switch question or additional agent, worker, task or
session is authorized.

Implementation completed with permanent RED/GREEN, exact work-order checks,
normal hooks, commit/push and ready PR #4179. Local review remediation is complete; corrected-head hosted delivery remains pending. Keep one heavy local
command at a time; retain and join every handle. Preserve others' edits,
processes, worktrees and caches. If dependencies are absent, one project-pinned
pnpm 9.15.9 frozen install from `apps/` precedes hooks; no lockfile change.

Delivery requires one owned `scripts/pr-await` monitor joined before any
replacement, current-head terminal required CI and an authenticated configured
CodeRabbit App 347564 full all-file semantic report with every actual finding
dispositioned. No ACK, skip, success check or duplicate optional review suffices.
Freeze the published SHA except for valid corrections; never rebase solely for
moving main. Use cheap merge-tree/blob compatibility evidence without synthetic
tests. Merge by normal expected-head squash without admin/bypass, independently
verify actual merged SHA/content/remote and join all owned handles before owned
cleanup. Parent handles archive and the next child. Send queued callbacks for
PR publication, concrete blockers/recovery, and verified merge with cleanup.

Unrelated CI needs exact failing leaf/log evidence and a queued parent report,
not a blind retry loop or scope expansion. If the known mobile history geometry
failure recurs, consult the parent; prior passing retries are not this head's
evidence. No local geometry build or broad audit is authorized.

## Verification results

Design checks on 2026-10-03:

- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed (343 decisions, 1321 specifications).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- Exported `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs` `validateCoverage`, using the four
  actual package documents plus intended runtime `git_log.go`: `ok: true`,
  `status: covered`, no errors; requirement/design/manifest/order links accepted.
  This is design coverage, not hosted PR evidence or an implementation pass.
- `git diff --check` and package status: passed; both work-package files exist.

At the design checkpoint, all four artifacts were unstaged/uncommitted; no
production/permanent tests, Go checks or dependency install had occurred. The
queued parent handoff ended that turn. The later explicit release and results
below supersede that historical pending state.

Implementation results: permanent process and registered-HTTP RED failed on
forced-color empty membership while controls passed. After the parent-released
exact allowlist dependency, scoped process/API/securityutil race GREEN passed
in 3.067s/1.867s/1.012s, all handles joined. Scoped changed lint passed with zero
issues. Catalog/spec lint, actual changed-file documentation coverage and
whitespace checks passed. One pinned pnpm 9.15.9 frozen install completed with
no tracked dependency changes. No full suite/browser/E2E/build was run.
Local order is complete. Initial normal hooks and publication passed; corrected-head
hooks, hosted gates, actual merge and joined owned cleanup remain delivery gates.

## Bounded validation dependency

The first GREEN attempt was rejected by the existing safe-flag validator. The
parent explicitly released one exact `--no-color` allowlist entry plus focused
allow/variant tests in common/securityutil, within this same sequential order.
No prefix widening, bypass, new producer or shared color policy is authorized.
The work order preserves all failed-run and joined-handle receipts.

## Risks

- A generic escape stripper would corrupt real source bytes.
- A color-disabled UI setting alone cannot control `color.diff=always`.
- Two empty results can falsely appear equivalent; assert positive membership.
- Configuration snapshots must bracket reads after disposable fixture setup.
- Root/merge/empty branches and binary metadata need positive controls independent
  of the initial two-text-file proof.
- Broader Git configuration behavior and unrelated producers stay outside scope.

## Hosted review remediation

Initial published head `6c00c2095784807c65910f67116375cfd1aa3c5f` passed
55 hosted checks (18 skipped, none failed/pending); waiter handle 50384 joined
exit 1 solely for unresolved review threads. CodeRabbit full review processed
all nine files and identified a valid colored fixture-oracle dependency. The
owned API test now seeds disposable global forced color before manager creation
and recomputes each oracle with explicit plain output, without changing the
shared fixture helper or production code. Its new tagged RED failed on exact
patch equality (0.246s, handle 59363 joined). Cubic findings are addressed by
recording the handoff as historical and matching future scoped commands to the
repository fts5 test configuration. Original untagged RED/GREEN receipts remain
accurate; unchanged passing process/securityutil tests are not replayed. Only
affected API validation and the mandatory full-backend changed lint run before
fixup push. Corrected-head hosted evidence remains required.

Local remediation verification: tagged affected API race GREEN passed in 1.797s
(handle 91801 joined). The mandatory full-backend changed lint first timed out
(exit 4, handle 27034 joined); zero reported issues did not constitute a pass.
The parent released one bounded recovery with an OS six-minute deadline and
GOMEMLIMIT=1GiB, retaining concurrency 2, serial runners and the five-minute lint
timeout at the exact base above. Recovery handle 15675 joined exit 0 with zero
issues. Original passing process/securityutil checks were not replayed.
Corrected-head CI/review and actual merge remain externally pending.

## Bounded hosted cancellation-fixture correction

At the intermediate corrective head, Backend Tests (2/2), run 37109953388,
job 111165825596, failed only `TestManagedGoCacheCancellationPreventsLaunch`
on temporary-directory cleanup: directory not empty. The parent released a
test-only repair in this same order after reading the direct/coalesced launch
contract. Empty `SessionID` selects direct launch with the caller context;
session-keyed coalescing deliberately detaches caller cancellation and can
continue after a canceled waiter returns. The fixture now exercises direct
launch, so the result channel joins cache preparation before zero-create
assertions and cleanup. Provider barriers, successful cache output, cancellation
and zero-create assertions remain intact. Production lifecycle behavior is
unchanged, consistent with the existing [cache cancellation design](../../specs/system-page/system-design/managed-go-cache-launch-fallback.md#cache-decision-and-recovery).

Only the exact cancellation test and preparation cancellation control ran with
`-race -trimpath -tags fts5 -p=1 -count=10`; corrected GREEN passed in 1.149s
(handle 42267 joined). Git checks were not replayed. The previous monitor was
intentionally stopped and joined (84748, exit 143, no terminal CI verdict).
A wrong-cwd edit attempt made no mutation; its unchanged-fixture test pass
(54535, 1.414s) is historical, not correction evidence. A prematurely overlapping
lint was stopped and joined (13917, exit 143, no verdict). After both handles
were joined and owned descendants absent, the parent authorized one sequential
replacement full changed-backend lint under the same bounded recovery flags.
Corrected-head semantic review, CI and actual merge remain pending.

Replacement full changed-backend lint joined exit 0 with zero issues (35060),
using the exact base and bounded flags above. Local remediation is complete;
new-head hosted review/CI and actual merge remain delivery gates.
