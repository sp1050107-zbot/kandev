# Task 10: Copilot on Every Workspace Page (WP-9)

## Summary

Mount a workspace-level copilot host: a launcher on every workspace page, the
phase-1 copilot in the shared right panel with a coordinator switcher, one
right panel at a time with the board's task preview, a phone sheet, and the
page chip for tasks and boards.

## Precondition

Phase-1 [task 11, panel swap](../workspace-coordinator/task-11-panel-swap.md)
has merged. It adds `RightSidePanel` (extracted from
`components/kanban-with-preview.tsx`) and its `mobileFullScreen` opt-in.
Before starting, confirm `grep -rl RightSidePanel apps/web/components` finds
the component; if it does not, this work order is blocked, not to be built
around.

## In scope

- Host in `src/app-shell.tsx` inside `WorkspaceScopeProvider`, for the
  `kanban`, `taskDetail` and `needsYouInbox` route kinds, with the workspace
  taken from the store's `workspaces.activeId`, never from the URL, and the
  visibility rules (`001.1`).
- Last-used coordinator per workspace in local storage, fallback to the
  first in list order (`001.2`); switcher (`001.3`).
- Panel body is the phase-1 `CoordinatorCopilot` with Open the coordinator
  page and no Expand (`001.4`).
- Store keeps the panel open across pages of one workspace, closes on a
  workspace change (`001.5`); one-right-panel rule with the task preview
  (`001.6`); `mobileFullScreen` sheet (`001.7`).
- Page chip from the resolved `SpaRoute` and the store: "This task:
  <identifier>" once the task is loaded and of the host's workspace, "This
  board: <workflow>" from `workflows.activeId`, none on the Inbox and none
  while the label is loading; tooltip, remove until the page changes; the
  phase-1 `transformOutgoing` prefix (`002.1` to `002.3`).
- "Not watched by this coordinator" from the Watches in the coordinator
  read (`002.4` client half; the server not-found half is task 02's guard);
  a foreign or unknown id sends only the id (`002.5`, a server test that
  the read tools return not found for another workspace's id).

- Split the phase-1 `CoordinatorCopilot` into panel content plus wrappers, turn
  `copilot-store.ts` into a `createCopilotStore()` factory with a store-handle
  parameter on `useCoordinatorCopilot`, and keep the reset bridge on the
  Coordinator instance only (see the design's Reuse boundary and Store).
- Widen `CopilotItemRefKind` and `COORDINATOR_REFERENCED_PREFIX_RE` to
  `workflow`, with unit cases.
- The one standing-instruction sentence for `[workflow:<id>]` in
  `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/prompt.go` with its `prompt_test.go`
  case; a server test that read tools return not found for another workspace's
  or an unknown task or workflow id.
- The router hook that returns the resolved route kind with the same feature
  options `SpaRoutes` passes, shared by the host and `SpaRoutes`.
- Put `identifier` into `snapshotToState` (`apps/web/lib/ssr/mapper.ts`) and
  `identifier` and `workspaceId` into the boot whitelist in
  `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/boot_state_routes.go`, with a test in each
  (the task chip's label source, `002.1`); a launcher of its own with the
  string "Ask your coordinator" placed above `WalkthroughOverlay`'s launcher
  and the phone bottom navigation (`001.1`, `001.7`); request identity and
  stale-response dropping (`001.9`).
- The coordinator list read, its re-read triggers and the coordinator GET
  re-fetch rules of the design's Host and Chip sections; `001.8`.

## Out of scope

- An Expand into Quick Chat (D11, not built).
- Any new coordinator read tool.

Closed: launcher (o) bottom right.
```

Phone: full-screen sheet with Close; the chip sits above the composer.

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

- [`assets/p2-03-task-page-copilot-context.png`](assets/p2-03-task-page-copilot-context.png)
- [`assets/p2-04-board-copilot-context.png`](assets/p2-04-board-copilot-context.png)
- Scenario `18-v21-copilot-anywhere` (launcher and chip) maps to
  `tests/coordinator/copilot-everywhere.spec.ts`.

## Acceptance

- The launcher shows exactly where `001.1` says, and nowhere with `phase2`
  off.
- Opening the panel on the board closes the task preview, and the reverse.
- A message sent with a chip is stored with the phase-1 prefix.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm test -- hooks/domains/coordinator app/coordinator/copilot components/task/chat/messages lib/ssr lib/coordinator
make -C apps/backend test PKG=./internal/backendapp/...
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run i18n:check
make -C apps/backend test PKG=./internal/coordinator/...
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run tests/coordinator/copilot-everywhere.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project=mobile-chrome tests/coordinator/copilot-everywhere.spec.ts
```

Unit: the store's panel rules and the last-used fallback. E2E: open on the
board, check the board chip and that the preview closed; navigate to a task
page and assert the panel stays and the chip changes; remove the chip, send,
and assert the stored message has no prefix; switch coordinators; a reader
sees no launcher; phone opens a sheet.

## Likely files

- `apps/web/app/coordinator/copilot/workspace-copilot-host.tsx`,
  `coordinator-switcher.tsx`, `workspace-copilot-launcher.tsx`,
  `workspace-page-chip.tsx` (new; the existing
  `coordinator-copilot-chip.tsx` is the phase-1 **Ask about this** chip and is
  left unchanged), `apps/web/lib/ssr/mapper.ts`,
  `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/boot_state_routes.go`
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/coordinator/copilot-store.ts` (factory),
  `apps/web/app/coordinator/copilot/coordinator-copilot.tsx`,
  `use-coordinator-copilot.ts`, `apps/web/components/coordinator-copilot-reset-bridge.tsx`,
  `apps/web/lib/coordinator/copilot-id.ts`,
  `apps/web/components/task/chat/messages/user-message-body.tsx`,
  `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/prompt.go` and `prompt_test.go`,
  `apps/web/src/spa-routes.tsx` (route-kind hook),
  `use-coordinator-launcher.ts`, `use-page-context-chip.ts`
- `apps/web/components/kanban-with-preview.tsx` (one right panel)
- `apps/web/src/app-shell.tsx`, which mounts the host

## Dependencies

- Task 01 (flag, Watches in the coordinator read).
- Phase-1 task 11, panel swap (`RightSidePanel`, `mobileFullScreen`); see
  [Precondition](#precondition).

## Risks

- The panel and task preview share `RightSidePanel`; both owners write the
  one store field, so the rule cannot be bypassed by a second mount.
