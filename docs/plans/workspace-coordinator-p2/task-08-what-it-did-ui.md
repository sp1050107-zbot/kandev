# Task 08: What It Did (WP-6)

## Summary

Add the What it did section below the Queue groups: newest-first rows with
paging, a class filter kept in the address, authorisation text, Undo for
managers, and the undone state.

## In scope

- Section and route wiring (`002.1`, `002.2` client half with cursor
  paging and Load more).
- Class filter with `?class=` (`002.3`); the May do link from task 06
  lands here.
- Row: relative time, action, class, how it was authorised (policy,
  approver, "with edits", refused count) (`002.4`).
- Empty and filtered-empty texts (`002.5`); reader view without Undo
  (`002.6`).
- "No undo" on every `message` or `resume` class row whatever its outcome,
  nothing on other non-undoable rows (`003.1`).
- Undo button on undoable rows; the "Undo this?" confirmation dialog of
  the design's Undo column (effect text per class, Undo and Cancel, Cancel
  focused, Cancel or Escape sends nothing); and the refusal handling of
  the design's Undo column: `already_undone` refetches with no error text,
  `not_undoable` shows "This can no longer be undone", `undo_conflict` shows the text of its `reason` (`moved`, `archived` or an unknown or absent reason "It has moved since"; `agent_running`, `step_deleted`, `step_done`, `step_full` each their own text, `003.7`), other errors show "Undo failed. Try again."
  and keep the button; "Undone by <name>, <time>" on the original
  reversed row from `undone_by` (resolved through the member list) and `undone_at`, and nothing in the
  Undo cell of the `undone` outcome row (`003.1`, `003.6`).
- Refresh on `coordinator.updated`. Six locales.

- Client-side names: member names from the workspace member list, step names
  and task availability from the Queue's snapshots (`002.8`, `002.9`,
  `003.10`); the server sends ids only.
- The full copy table of the system design in six locales, with whole-sentence
  undo dialog fallbacks and the conflict text for an unknown reason.
- Undo failure lifecycle (`003.11`): inline below the still-clickable Undo,
  cleared on the next successful re-read, filter change or a new confirmed Undo.

## Out of scope

- Undo semantics (task 03).

## ASCII UI preview

Non-normative sketch; the copy table and ACs of the system design win where
they differ. From [UI-01](plan.md#ui-01-what-it-did-entry-queue-below-the-groups):

```text
What it did                                        Action class [All      v]
| When       | Action                          | Action class | How it was authorised       | Undo     |
| 2 min ago  | Retry webhooks KAN-431          | Create task  | Requires approval           | [Undo]   |
|            |                                 |              | Approved by Ana, with edits |          |
| 1 h ago    | Build to Review KAN-411         | Move task    | Requires approval           | [Undo]   |
|            |                                 |              | Approved by Ana             | It has moved since |
| 5 h ago    | It called something it is not   | Message task | Denied x 3                  | No undo  |
|            | allowed to use.                 |              |                             |          |
                                  [Load more]
```

The Action cell shows the row's detail with the identifier after it, never an
invented verb. The "It has moved since" text is a temporary message under a
still-clickable Undo. Refused and other message or resume rows read "No undo".
Phone: each row is a card; Undo is a full-width button.

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

- [`assets/p2-01-queue-what-it-did.png`](assets/p2-01-queue-what-it-did.png)
- No mockup scenario; `tests/coordinator/what-it-did.spec.ts` is new.

## Acceptance

- Rows render every row kind the log can hold, in time order, with paging.
- Undo is offered only where the server says it is undoable, and a conflict
  shows its text without removing the row.
- A component test mocks each undo refusal: `already_undone` shows no error
  and refetches to "Undone by", `not_undoable` shows its text and `undo_conflict` shows one text per reason (all six reasons plus an absent one), and a 500 shows "Undo failed. Try again." with the button
  still there.
- Component tests for the list lifecycle: a refresh re-reads every loaded page
  and a row beyond page 1 flips to "Undone by"; a response for a discarded
  filter is dropped; a failed first load shows the load-failed text and Retry,
  not the empty text; a failed Load more keeps rows and button; Enter in the
  dialog never sends an undo; the filter change replaces the address; a
  message survives its own triggered re-read but not an event re-read.
- A component test renders a `proposed` message row and a `refused`
  message row and asserts "No undo" on both, and nothing in the Undo cell
  of a `rejected` create row.
- A component test renders an undone create row (approver Ana,
  `undone_by` Bo's id, member list holding Bo) and its `undone` outcome row, and asserts "Undone by
  Bo" on the original row, no Undo on it, and an empty Undo cell on the
  `undone` row.
- A component test clicks Undo on a create row and asserts the dialog
  "Undo this?" with "The task <identifier> will be archived." and focus on
  Cancel; Cancel sends no request; confirming sends one undo request.

- Component tests: every copy-table key renders in its form (approved named,
  no person, former member, edited; rejected and failed prefixes with and
  without detail; each refusal reason and an unknown code); "Task no longer
  available" only for a target id absent from loaded snapshots (not for a
  row with no target, not while snapshots load or failed); all six dialog
  sentences; the conflict text for an unknown reason; the message survives
  Load more, clears on filter change, and `not_undoable` survives one
  refetch. A locale test asserts every new copy-table key (not the existing
  `activityChip*` and `activityVerb*` keys) exists in all six
  locales with the placeholders of its English value kept (each key its own set of
  `{{name}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{count}}`, `{{identifier}}`, `{{step}}`, `{{code}}`
  and `{{detail}}`).

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm test -- app/coordinator/queue/what-it-did
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run i18n:check
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run tests/coordinator/what-it-did.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project=mobile-chrome tests/coordinator/what-it-did.spec.ts
```

E2E: the mock agent proposes a task, the manager approves, the row appears;
Undo archives the task and the row reads "Undone by"; filter to Move shows
the filtered-empty text; a reader sees rows and no Undo.

## Likely files

- `apps/web/app/coordinator/queue/what-it-did.tsx`,
  `what-it-did-row.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/coordinator/` Queue view composition
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/coordinator/use-activity.ts`

## Dependencies

- Task 03 (routes).

## Risks

- A long log must not slow the Queue: the section loads its first page after
  the Queue groups render.
