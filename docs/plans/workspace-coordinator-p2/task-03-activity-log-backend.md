# Task 03: Activity Log Backend (WP-6)

## Summary

Write a log row in the same transaction as every proposal change, through
task 01's writer, and serve the list, summary and undo routes, the coordinator's
read tool and daily retention. This is the phase-3 evidence source.

## In scope

- Hooks in the phase-1 create path, through task 01's `Record`: propose insert, completion to
  `approved` (with `edited`), reject, failure to `failed`. Task 04 adds the
  same calls for the other kinds through the shared writer.
- `RecordRefusal` publishes `coordinator.updated` after its transaction
  commits (insert or coalesce); `undo.go` defines the task-service seam.
- Routes `GET activity`, `GET activity/summary`, `POST activity/:rid/undo`
  with cursor paging, class filter, scopes and 404 across workspaces.
- Undo for `create_task` (archive) and `move` (move back) with the
  per-row mutex, `already_undone`, `not_undoable`, `undo_conflict`. Move undo
  reads `outcome_json` written by task 04; its tests seed that column.
- `list_coordinator_activity_kandev` and the `coordinator.list_activity`
  MCP action, principal-scoped, without user identities.
- `Service.ActivitySummary(ctx, coordinatorID, days)` and the daily retention
  ticker plus the startup-pass run.

## Out of scope

- The What it did screen (task 08).
- The writer and refusal coalescing (task 01); the guard's `RecordRefusal`
  call (task 02).
- Naming the read tool in the bound profile (task 02's `ToolNames`). This
  task adds the tool's `ToolForAction` row and handler, which makes task 02's
  `registerCoordinatorTools` register it.

## Acceptance

- Each proposal change leaves exactly one row in the same transaction; a
  failed row insert rolls the proposal change back.
- Undo reverses a create or a move once; conflicts return their codes.

## Verification

```bash
make -C apps/backend test PKG=./internal/coordinator/...
make -C apps/backend test PKG=./internal/mcp/...
```

Tests: a fault-injected row insert leaves the proposal unchanged
(the hook half of task 01's `001.6`); a losing claimer writes no row; a direct Resume or Send it back writes nothing (`001.5`, a source-scan test
that `stalls.go`, `recovery.go` and the resume paths contain no `Record` call,
because those web paths never enter the coordinator package);
two concurrent undos of one create archive once and return one 409
(`003.4`); a moved-again task returns `undo_conflict` (`003.3`); a failed
marker transaction leaves the row undoable and a retry only marks it
(reversal already done); a `noop` move row is `not_undoable` and lists
`undoable` false; an undone row lists `undone_by_name` resolved from
`undone_by` while its `actor_name` stays the approver, and a deleted
undoer reads "A former member" (the field task 08 renders); the summary's `approved` includes edited approvals and
`undone` counts under the reversed row's class (`005.2`); a reader's
undo is 403 (`003.5`); the read tool never returns another coordinator's
rows or any user id (`004.1`, `004.2`); limit 0 and 51 are refused
(`004.3`); retention deletes a 401-day-old row and keeps a 399-day-old one
(`005.1`); with `phase2` off the startup pass and ticker do not run and a
401-day-old row survives (`005.1`); a move undo retried after a failed
marker finds the task on `from_step_id`, skips `MoveTask` and marks the row
(`003.3`); summary counts and `days=0`/`91` refusals (`005.2`); another
workspace's coordinator is 404 (`005.3`); undo of a move with a running
agent session is 409 `undo_conflict` reason `agent_running` and leaves the row
undoable, a deleted `from_step_id` is reason `step_deleted`, and the move
enters the step with `SkipStepPrompt` (`003.7`, `003.8`); with auth off
`undone_by` and `actor_user_id` are NULL and the list shows null names
(`003.6`); a row with NULL `outcome_json`, an unparseable one, a missing
proposal or a create row without `target_task_id` lists `undoable` false and
undo is `not_undoable` (`003.9`); `limit` 0, 51, empty and `abc`, an empty
`class` (All) and a repeated `class` behave per `002.3` and `002.7`; the last
page has a null `next_cursor`; a refusal publishes `coordinator.updated`; a
second undo waiting on the row mutex returns the context error when its
request ends; retention runs never overlap and the delete-scan test admits
`retention.go`; undo of a move runs the `003.7` checks in order (a task on
the from step is moved back with no call; `step_done`, `step_full`,
`agent_running` and `step_deleted` leave the row undoable; a WIP-queued task
counts as moved back; `SkipStepPrompt` is set only for an auto-start step);
undo of a create archives a task with a running agent; a row deleted by
retention mid-undo is 404; cursor validation, repeated `limit`/`before`/`days`
and empty `days` are 400; a failing user service leaves the list served with
null names; an unset actor with an existing user names it and a missing user
sets `actor_missing`; retention starts no ticker and no startup run when the flag is off, and stops on context cancel.

## Likely files

- `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/activity_routes.go`,
  `proposals.go`, `retention.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/mcp/server/coordinator_tools.go`,
  `internal/mcp/handlers/` (the list action)

## Dependencies

- Task 01 (table, writer, types, client shapes).

## Risks

- Holding a database lock across a task-service write deadlocks SQLite;
  the undo mutex is in-process by design.
