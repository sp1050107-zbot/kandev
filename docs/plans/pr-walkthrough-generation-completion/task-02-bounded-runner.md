# Task 02: Supervise generation and narrow Git fetching

## Summary

Complete generation after a verified render and bound all attempts by one deadline. Fetch only the two histories needed for context while preserving an exact trusted checkout.

## In scope

- Add a trusted Python runner adapter with standard-library process-group supervision.
- Poll the receipt every 250 milliseconds and terminate the owned agent group after observing completion.
- Apply one 600-second monotonic deadline across both attempts. Reserve a separate cleanup interval of at most 10 seconds.
- Use SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after five seconds, and reap owned processes before verification.
- Distinguish supervised completion from an unexpected non-zero process exit.
- Keep one clean retry for zero-exit incomplete output within the remaining deadline.
- Treat external cancellation as terminal failure even if output files exist.
- Capture start/end timestamps, elapsed time, raw exit status, stop reason, verification result, streams, and draft for each attempt.
- Set the generation job limit to 20 minutes. Bound checkout to two minutes, history fetching to four, context preparation to one, and installation to one.
- Bound independent verification to 30 seconds. Retain at least one minute for artifact upload after the preparation and generation budgets.
- Add `.github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-history.sh` and its local Git regression suite.
- Check out depth one at `github.workflow_sha`. Fetch complete histories only for that SHA and the PR-head ref, then validate exact head and merge base.
- Wire the adapter, verifier, and new tests into the walkthrough and CI lint workflows.

## Out of scope

- Retry after timeout, provider errors, unexpected non-zero exits, cancellation, or invalid receipts.
- Granting the agent access to the supervisor, verifier, receipts, or output files.
- Changing provider, publication gates, workflow concurrency, or PR-description behavior.

## Acceptance

- `test_render_then_idle_completes` invokes the real renderer from a fake agent that then waits forever. The runner stops its group and accepts the verified outputs.
- Tests reject stale or invalid receipts, partial or mismatched files, unexpected exits, and external cancellation. They prove deadline sharing, retry limits, and cleanup of owned descendants.
- A shallow local clone with divergent trusted and PR branches gains a merge base through targeted fetching. The checkout stays trusted and unrelated branches and tags are absent. Existing workflow security assertions continue to pass.

## Verification

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-runner_test.py
bash .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-history_test.sh
python3 .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-workflow-contract_test.py
python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-render.test.py
python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-verify.test.py
python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-context.test.py
python3 scripts/pr-walkthrough-pr-body.test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning_test.py
python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning.py
actionlint .github/workflows/pr-walkthrough.yml .github/workflows/lint-action-pinning.yml
zizmor .github/workflows
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

Record existing unrelated zizmor findings separately. The changed jobs must introduce no new finding.

## Dependencies

Task 01 supplies the receipt and verifier. Keep the workflow and helper revision aligned at the trusted workflow SHA.

## Risks

- Cancellation races must never become publication success.
- Test clocks and short fixture deadlines must replace long sleeps.
- Remove old static assertions for the inline retry loop only after behavioral runner tests cover the same contract.
- Targeted unshallow fetching still needs sufficient history for old or divergent PR heads.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Requirement AC-UI-PR-WALKTHROUGH-001.6, .7, .13, and .14.
- System-design sections: Runner supervision, Git history preparation, and Generation diagnostics.
- `.github/AGENTS.md` and the existing workflow contract suite.
- [Previous retry package](../pr-walkthrough-runner-reliability-fix/task-02-retry-incomplete-opencode-output.md).

## Results

Added the trusted runner with receipt polling, process-group cleanup, a shared
600-second deadline, one clean incomplete-output retry, cancellation handling,
independent verification, per-attempt diagnostics, and a workflow summary.
Added targeted history fetching that preserves the trusted checkout and rejects
an unexpected PR head or missing merge base. The workflow now uses depth-one
checkout and bounded preparation and generation steps with time for artifact
upload.

Follow-up review fixes classify an already-observed natural process exit before
accepting a receipt, while preserving valid natural zero-exit and supervised
completion. Failed owned-group cleanup on an incomplete zero-exit attempt now
terminates the run before verification or retry.

Verification passed:

- `python3 .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-runner_test.py` (17 tests, including regressions for observed natural exits, receipt-before-renderer-exit completion, zombie-only process groups, terminal cleanup failure, and cleanup-summary diagnostics)
- `bash .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-history_test.sh`
- `python3 .github/scripts/pr-walkthrough-workflow-contract_test.py` (30 tests)
- `python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-render.test.py` (10 tests)
- `python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-verify.test.py` (8 tests, including renderer import and syntax diagnostics)
- `python3 .agents/skills/pr-walkthrough/scripts/pr-walkthrough-context.test.py` (4 tests)
- `python3 scripts/pr-walkthrough-pr-body.test.py` (9 tests)
- `python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning_test.py` (9 tests)
- `python3 .github/scripts/lint-action-pinning.py` (25 workflow files)
- `go run github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest .github/workflows/pr-walkthrough.yml .github/workflows/lint-action-pinning.yml`
- Python compile checks, Bash syntax checks, harness lint, specification validation and lint, and `git diff --check`

The full `zizmor .github/workflows` audit remains nonzero because of existing
repository findings. The focused audit reports the unchanged
`pull_request_target` trigger finding, which also appears on the workflow at
`HEAD`; no new finding was introduced.
