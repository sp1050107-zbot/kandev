# Implementation Plan: Preserve Exact Workspace Search Filenames

## Overview

Correct Git-backed inventory once, so cached Files search and fresh Contents search retain native filename identity through their registered API results. One sequential work order owns the parser, real-Git regressions and registered aggregate/selected API proof. ROOT released this reviewed package for implementation in the existing session on 2026-10-05. Delivery requires the current local-heavy lease and a separate later merge lease.

Actual clean starting base: `e095ca17790d3dd0e4700b473780add77ac7a230`. Both suspect source blobs match proofbase `91da5a242f145b0bb7d0303b4969fdc1552811e5`: `workspace_files.go` = `0b15f380fed26113355dc8eab0437b1a78cfa81a`; `workspace_content_search.go` = `b34348de1503a81826c742060a43079b6de66d0f`.

ROOT may overlap this child's design/read-only work and hosted CI with a disjoint persistent child. One global local-heavy-command lease spans ROOT and both children. This child needs ROOT's explicit current lease before install, Go tests/lint, Vitest/typecheck/build or heavy normal hooks, even after implementation release. Actually join the local tranche, record zero owned live handles and return the lease before hosted waiting; reacquire for later local corrections. ROOT serializes merge and independent archive. No shared locking/harness mechanism or delegates are introduced; the paused oversized task remains untouched.

## Evidence and root cause

The accepted ROOT `TestRootNextExactInventoryDiagnostic` used real production `getFileList`, `updateFiles`/`SearchFiles` and `SearchContent` with private real Git repositories. Inner Go exit was 1; the wrapper exit 0 honestly records that failure. Handle 95599 was joined; elapsed 8.085 seconds, package 0.113 seconds. The ordinary `plaininventory.txt` control passed while five supported Unicode/leading-space/tab/newline cases failed exact inventory, filename search and content search. Retain the immutable `/tmp/kandev-exact-inventory-repro_test.go` (mode 0444, SHA256 `821484a37235ee89517be408c5a3949e694a38b8f78b800c1ce6b68ccaa0952c`), receipt and log; do not replay or remove them.

At the starting base, `getFileListClass` splits newline output, trims each record/path and assumes any tab separates tracked metadata. Default Git quoting and escaped output lose Unicode/control-character identity; trimming loses spaces. Untracked filenames can resemble the tracked header. Content search then silently skips nonexistent altered paths. `resolveSafePath` preserves supported native names and needs no redesign.

ROOT's `/tmp/kandev-root-next-file-list-raw-probe.json` is only raw Git/source-parser evidence, including an untracked metadata-lookalike and a genuine Gitlink. The independent design grammar receipt `/tmp/kandev-exact-inventory-grammar-design-receipt.json` is also raw Git only: Git 2.43 confirms H/S/M/? tags, modes 100644/100755/120000/160000, stages 0..3 and exact untracked remainder. Its SHA256 is `1b42f532d7982f0b7f1258ad1963743d915cba1544d5610565776fece8e59058`; its private repository was removed. Neither raw probe establishes production GREEN.

## Scope

### In scope

- Reuse active task-search AC .6/.7/.8 and add only missing filename identity AC .9 in the existing owner.
- Source-local tagged NUL inventory from one `ls-files` call, including legitimate indexed tags/stages, true Gitlink and root-only marker handling.
- Real production inventory/cache/search and registered aggregate search plus selected file-read transport proof.

### Out of scope

- File protocol redesign, generic parser framework, broad permission/path audit, cache ownership migration, status/monitor changes, ranking/deduplication changes and invalid-UTF8 filename JSON support.
- Frontend interaction changes, browser/build/local E2E, broad backend suites, PostgreSQL and new flags or dependencies.
- Proof replay, foreign resources/shared cache changes, native agents, delegates, new tasks/sessions/tabs or model changes.

## Technical approach

Implement the [exact inventory design](../../specs/ui/system-design/task-workspace-content-search.md#exact-git-inventory-and-search-consumption) in `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/process/workspace_files.go:getFileListClass`. Preserve the current admission/deadline/environment/error plumbing. Extract a small source-local helper only if needed for readability/lint; do not introduce a shared framework or test-only production seam. `SearchContent` and safe-path production code should require no edits.

| Boundary | Identity contract | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git output | Tagged NUL records; H/S/M header versus ? literal payload | Real Git fixtures; no shell output display helper as parser input |
| Inventory/cache | Exact slash-separated repository-relative path; fresh returned slice | Production enumeration and `updateFiles`, no seeded `currentFiles` substitute |
| Filename API | Legacy files plus repository-qualified structured results | Registered GET search and JSON decoding |
| Content API | Repository-relative path plus raw repository identity/ranges/preview | Registered GET content-search and JSON decoding |
| Selected read | URL-encoded repo/path reaches correct same-path sentinel | Registered GET file/content; aggregate routes remain aggregate |
| Native Windows | Unicode/ordinary and transport remain covered | Narrow only actually unsupported quote/control/trailing-name or symlink cases; no whole-suite skip |

## Tests

Primary inventory/search regressions live in new `workspace_inventory_exact_paths_test.go`; transport regressions in new `workspace_search_exact_paths_test.go`. The [work order](task-01-preserve-exact-search-paths.md#verification) names exact methods/commands. Cover tracked/untracked Unicode, whitespace, quote/tab/newline cases, an actual untracked stage-header lookalike with a distinct decoy, default/true/false quotePath, ordinary/empty controls, ignored content, Gitlinks, nested/root markers, indexed modes and stage multiplicity. Assert independent expected strings and sentinels, content coordinates/ranges/preview, and before/after Git/index/config/file invariants.

Existing submodule/root, bare sibling aggregation, content eligibility/ranges and admission/cancellation tests provide bounded compatibility checks. Existing `submodule-workspace-search` and `content-search-match-reveal` packages are completed historical delivery records; this correction changes none of their work orders, E2E matrices or prior results.

## End-to-end evidence and mobile assessment

Registered server routes backed by real Git and filesystem are the end-to-end boundary for this data correction. Aggregate search results are decoded and used to request the selected file in the same server. Mobile-parity was assessed: no rendering, touch, navigation, scrolling, breakpoint or frontend logic changes. Desktop and phone consume shared corrected data; no browser, build, ASCII UI preview or local E2E is scheduled.

## Documentation and engineering guidance

Public `sessions-and-review.md` already promises tracked/nonignored content search and independent repository results. The correction restores that documented behavior; no command/config/API shape, workflow, terminology or screenshot changes. No public-doc edit is needed. Reassess if actual implementation scope changes.

Root, backend, agentctl and API engineering guides remain accurate: classified managed Git, instance environment snapshots, containment, scoped reads and cleanup remain intact. No package, adapter, store, exported contract or repo convention changes; no guide correction is necessary. Before publication, recheck the final diff and update the relevant guide if this assessment stops being true. No ADR: this local parser correction preserves an existing contract, and its narrow transport rationale is sufficiently recorded in the owning design/work order.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Preserve exact search paths](task-01-preserve-exact-search-paths.md)

The checked work order and `implemented` manifest status record completed local implementation and verification under `/fix` Phase 4. They do not complete the persistent Kandev task or its Phase 5 delivery. The external Kandev task plan tracks the pending six required hosted gates, full semantic review, findings disposition, separately authorized actual merge and joined cleanup.

## Verification results

Task 01 implemented after ROOT's explicit release on 2026-10-05. Production changes only the managed `ls-files` flags and source-local record extraction in `workspace_files.go`. The two new real-Git regression files exercise the accepted inventory/cache/search and registered transport matrix, including independent same-path sentinels, read-only bytes and stage multiplicity. Scope and guide/public-doc assessments remain accurate.

Faithful permanent RED handle 51865 joined with exit 1 (three new families fail, 14 controls pass); GREEN handle 6250 joined with exit 0 (17 top-level tests: 13 process, 4 API; packages 2.694s/1.991s). Scoped two-package lint handle 21986 joined with exit 0 and zero issues against the starting base. Full commands and receipts are in the [work order](task-01-preserve-exact-search-paths.md#results). A prior missing-directory fixture failure was corrected and is not reported as production RED. Supplied ROOT proof remains untouched.

Design catalog, all-spec lint, 36 linter tests, projected documentation coverage and whitespace checks passed before release. Final catalog/specification lint, whitespace and staged/committed-head documentation coverage passed for initial publication. The single pinned pnpm 9.15.9 frozen install completed successfully (handle 30915 joined, exit 0). Normal hooks, commit, push and ready PR publication completed under the initial local lease, which was returned with zero live local handles. Hosted gates, full review/findings disposition, actual merge and joined cleanup remain pending delivery barriers in the external Kandev task plan. Later publication requires a new local-heavy lease; actual merge requires a separate ROOT merge lease. No local browser/build/E2E/PG or broad backend suites are scheduled.

## Risks

- Assuming only H tracked records would hide skip-worktree or unmerged entries. Preserve their tags and stage multiplicity.
- Trimming, unquoting or splitting a path's tabs/newlines can select a decoy. Exact path plus distinct sentinel assertions must catch this.
- Cache initialization can make API tests pass empty or leak monitor goroutines. Await an observable complete scan and join only owned managers.
- Native filesystem restrictions vary; scope skips by case, retaining ordinary/Unicode/transport assertions on Windows.
- Resource/transport failures are no pass and require a durable WAITING checkpoint to ROOT, without automatic retry.
