# Task 01: Preserve negative-projection PR details

## Summary

Keep linked PR content after a newer task summary clears approval.
Suppress stale approval without a blank or automation-only disclosure.
Prove the same outcome in desktop hover/focus and the existing phone drawer.

## In scope

- A negative-projection disclosure helper and its integration into the PR task view model.
- Full identity retention, independent status rows, terminal lifecycle, counts, and conflict attribution.
- Projection/component regressions and two focused rendered scenarios.

## Out of scope

- Provider/API/store schema changes, polling, merge authorization, and automation mutations.
- Tooltip geometry, scroll mechanics, positive-projection redesign, new copy, and new mobile surfaces.

## Acceptance

1. Every cached linked PR retains its number, title, author, and applicable status after a newer explicit negative.
2. No cleared approval row or stale approval note survives the negative, and freshness/positive behavior keeps its existing guards.
3. Desktop hover/focus and phone tap show that content, preserve counts and conflict attribution, and require no extra provider reads.

These conditions map to the complete acceptance IDs in frontmatter.

See [UI-01 and UI-02](plan.md#ascii-ui-preview).

```

A newer negative removes approval text, not the PR entry.
Open PR automation follows the retained summary inside the existing body.
The phone control opens its existing drawer without task navigation.
Summary AC 001.2/.3/.17/.24 and workflow AC 003.4/.8 define these outcomes.

## Implementation sequence

1. Mark this work order `in_progress`.
2. Extend the existing newer-negative component test to require title, author, and status content.
3. Add merged, closed, open-automation, mixed-sibling, and repository-collision cases.
4. Run the regression and record its expected missing-content failure before production changes.
5. Add the focused projection helper and negative-path view-model integration.
6. Preserve the existing positive projection and freshness behavior.
7. Add deterministic desktop and phone response-fixture regressions from the plan.
8. Run the commands below sequentially and record actual results.
9. Mark this work order `done` and update the plan after all checks pass.

The temporary investigation test is removed. Recreate its behavior in permanent tests during TDD.

## Verification

Run from the repository root.
If the worktree lacks dependencies, install them first:

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
```

The managed E2E runner rebuilds runtime and web assets.
Run the two E2E commands sequentially with one shard and the guarded worker budget.

```bash
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run components/github/pr-task-workflow-projection.test.ts components/github/pr-task-icon.workflow-approval.test.tsx components/github/pr-task-icon.negative-projection.test.tsx components/github/pr-task-icon.render.test.tsx components/github/pr-task-status-summary.test.ts hooks/domains/github/use-task-pr-tooltip-hydration.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec eslint components/github/pr-task-workflow-projection.ts components/github/pr-task-icon.tsx components/github/pr-task-workflow-projection.test.ts components/github/pr-task-icon.workflow-approval.test.tsx components/github/pr-task-icon.negative-projection.test.tsx e2e/helpers/pr-negative-projection-fixture.ts e2e/tests/pr/pr-sidebar-hover-hydration.spec.ts e2e/tests/pr/mobile-pr-sidebar-automation-indicators.spec.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:ratchet)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --host --shards 1 --project chromium -- e2e/tests/pr/pr-sidebar-hover-hydration.spec.ts --workers=1 --retries=0)
(cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --host --shards 1 --project mobile-chrome -- e2e/tests/pr/mobile-pr-sidebar-automation-indicators.spec.ts --workers=1 --retries=0)
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

Capture the desktop merged hover and phone merged drawer through the existing `prCapture` fixture.
Require actual visible PR content inside the active overlay, not hidden tooltip description text.

## Files likely touched

Owned production files:

- `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-workflow-projection.ts`
- `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-icon.tsx`

Owned regression files:

- `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-workflow-projection.test.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-icon.workflow-approval.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-icon.negative-projection.test.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/e2e/helpers/pr-negative-projection-fixture.ts` (new)
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/pr/pr-sidebar-hover-hydration.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/pr/mobile-pr-sidebar-automation-indicators.spec.ts`

## Dependencies

None. The existing summary, hover-hydration, and workflow-approval packages are complete.
Their completed results remain historical evidence.

## Risks

The helper must clear approval across every open sibling without changing independent provider statuses.
Same-number PRs require repository identity for conflict attribution.
A single compact lifecycle cannot replace every sibling lifecycle.
E2E response fixtures must preserve the real workspace and association scope.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [PR task summary requirements](../../specs/ui/requirements/pr-task-status-summary.md).
- [Workflow attention requirements](../../specs/integrations/requirements/github-workflow-attention.md).
- [Shared summary design](../../specs/ui/system-design/pr-task-status-summary.md).
- [Negative approval disclosure design](../../specs/integrations/system-design/github-workflow-attention.md#negative-approval-disclosure).
- The existing newer positive/negative cases in `pr-task-icon.workflow-approval.test.tsx`.
- The existing desktop inactive-task and phone automation E2E fixtures.

## Results

The original regressions passed after implementation. Before the fix, both new browser scenarios reached the newer-negative fixture branch and failed because the PR status number was absent.

Review follow-ups on 2026-10-02 fixed four projection gaps: terminal lifecycle was not applied when sibling PRs existed, cached conflicts survived an explicit negative conflict summary, compact conflicts could inherit the approval repository for a same-number PR, and readiness rows remained alongside new conflict evidence. Before the fixes, the new pure-helper tests failed on conflict attribution, conflict clearing, and both terminal states among siblings; the component tests failed on both terminal states and attributed conflict clearing.

- Focused unit/component suite: 6 files and 90 tests passed, including merged/closed sibling targeting, explicit conflict clearing, same-number repository attribution, and queue-row handling.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: passed.
- Targeted ESLint across the changed production, regression, helper, and E2E files: passed without warnings.
- Prettier check across the changed projection, regression, helper, and E2E files: passed.
- `pnpm run i18n:ratchet`: passed with zero added or modified copy violations; guard allowlist intact.
- Desktop Chromium sidebar spec: 3 tests passed after a fresh backend and web build, including merged details and keyboard reopen without a fetch.
- Mobile Chrome sidebar spec: 3 tests passed after a fresh backend and web build, including drawer content, focus return, and viewport checks.
- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: 339 decisions and 1,281 specifications validated.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: all specification files passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed after recording results.

## PR fixup verification (2026-10-02)

The retries-disabled replay of the archived shard exposed a fixture failure in the initial root tree: the response succeeded, but the task workspace did not contain `navigation-root.ts` or its sibling fixture files. `seedNavigationTasks` had committed them only to the local checkout. It now creates and pushes a unique branch from `origin/main`, then pins both tasks to that branch. The desktop Files panel is foregrounded before opening its tab, and the test waits for each matching tree response before checking the rendered rows.

- Before the fixture fix, the exact archived shard replay ran in the CI runtime container with one worker and retries disabled: 254 passed, 6 skipped, 1 failed in 22.5 minutes. The response capture confirmed the absent fixture files in the successful root response.
- Ordered regression after the fix: `file-tree-chat-context.spec.ts`, `large-file-tree-virtualization.spec.ts`, and `task-navigation-responsiveness.spec.ts` passed 7/7 in Chromium with retries disabled.
- Fresh-build Chromium navigation spec passed 3/3; Mobile Chrome navigation spec passed 1/1 with retries disabled.
- WebSocket client suite passed 29/29, including the queued-request timeout regression. The six disclosure unit/component files passed 90/90.
- Web typecheck, warning-free targeted ESLint, Prettier check, and i18n ratchet passed. The E2E production build passed.
- The other initial failed CI leaf was checked against a temporary merge of PR head `b208a2a54cd86a03df03b809e3701865135a8e43` and current `main` `0ec0538aa038f2e8b8617fb4f5be6128f0cedbac`. The exact commit-spacing test passed 1/1 in the CI runtime container with retries disabled; current `main`'s row-size alignment resolves that assertion.
- Documentation validation remains the prior 339-decision / 1,281-specification pass; no specification files changed during this fixup. `git diff --check` passed after recording these results.

PR CI on the pushed head reached terminal with 50 passed, 16 skipped, and no failed checks. Its retry artifact contained seven first-attempt failures that passed on retry, so that run did not validate the final fixture correction below.

## E2E retry finding and fixture isolation (2026-10-02)

The PR retry artifacts showed seven first-attempt failures that all passed on retry, with no final failures or timeouts. One was the changed navigation test: after a review test left `review_cumulative_test.txt` modified in the worker's shared repository checkout, `seedNavigationTasks` failed while checking out `origin/main`. Six retry-only failures came from unchanged review and mobile E2E specs.

Navigation branch setup now creates and pushes fixture commits from a temporary Git worktree. It leaves the shared checkout's branch and local changes untouched. A new browser regression creates a divergent dirty branch, verifies the branch fixture is pushed while the checkout stays unchanged, and cleans up the temporary state. The existing navigation flow remains a separate clean-checkout test.

- Before the fixture isolation change, the regression failed at `git checkout -b` with the same local-change conflict found in the PR artifact.
- Afterward, `pnpm e2e:run --project chromium tests/task/task-navigation-responsiveness.spec.ts` passed 4/4, including the dirty-checkout regression and the existing navigation flow.
- `pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome tests/task/mobile-task-navigation-responsiveness.spec.ts` passed 1/1.
- Web typecheck, targeted ESLint, Prettier, i18n ratchet, E2E sleep ratchet, and `git diff --check` passed.

Fixture isolation is pushed as `8bcf6d838ef`. Fresh PR CI on that head completed with 50 passed, 16 skipped, and no failed or pending checks. The first `pr-walkthrough-generate` attempt stopped at the model deadline; rerunning that failed job passed.

- The final E2E retry summary recorded 3,645 executed tests, 47 skipped, zero final failures/timeouts, and four tests that passed after retry (five retry attempts total). The dirty-checkout regression passed on its first attempt.
- The four retry-only cases were the office taskless-routine test, session refresh-efficiency test, disabled-agent-profile navigation test, and the existing mounted-task-panel request-deduplication test. The latter had two duplicate-request assertion failures before passing; the focused desktop spec passed all four tests locally.
- `scripts/playwright-blob-audit` found no parse errors. It reported the retry-only failures above; no final unexpected outcome remained.
- `scripts/pr-state --summary 4151` showed no failed or pending checks and zero unresolved review threads. `git merge-tree --write-tree FETCH_HEAD HEAD` was conflict-free against current `main` `1793d42de0a`.
- Local desktop navigation E2E passed 4/4; mobile navigation E2E passed 1/1. Typecheck, targeted ESLint, Prettier, i18n ratchet, E2E sleep ratchet, and `git diff --check` passed.
