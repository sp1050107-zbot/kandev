# Task 02: Fragment guidance and public documentation

## Summary

Make the bounded read and existing partial writes the advertised path for
focused plan changes. Keep full-context planning available and preserve the
session and workflow instructions around the plan guidance.

## In scope

- Update task/Office context, plan-mode/default-plan instructions, applicable
  built-in workflow text, and the active-plan `buildDocumentContext` block.
- Explain character offsets, first-page/continuation calls, version reuse,
  post-write offset invalidation, and exact-edit/append selection. Never imply
  that a partial read is a complete replacement document.
- Extend sysprompt and document-context tests to assert new guidance, preserve
  system wrappers and identity/phase/question gates, and keep excluded profiles
  free of plan authority. Use behavioral instructions rather than snapshots of
  whole prompts. Preserve the existing agent-only i18n exemption.
- Update existing MCP public reference/how-to sections with the final supported
  fields, example calls, bounds, EOF, conflicts, and full-read compatibility.
- Reconcile any contradictory full-read-only wording in the existing safe-edit
  design when the new read implementation is ready. Keep existing safety
  requirements and recovery rules intact.
- Record results and promote the paired draft specs and plan after both work
  orders pass and implementation matches the package.

## Out of scope

- New read/write implementation, changes to approval barriers, or model routing.
- Rendered UI copy, layout, touch interactions, and viewport behavior.

## Acceptance

1. All applicable agent plan guidance advertises bounded reads and fragment
   writes without forcing an unnecessary full read or weakening safety gates.
2. Prompt regression tests prove the active-plan and system instruction paths
   preserve their wrappers and workflow behavior; public examples match the
   implementation and pass documentation validation.
3. Required checks are recorded, paired specs reflect delivered behavior, and
   work-order/plan lifecycle is updated only after both orders pass.

## Verification

If workspace dependencies are absent, first run
`(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)`.

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -trimpath -tags fts5 ./internal/sysprompt -count=1)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run hooks/use-message-handler.test.ts hooks/use-message-handler.plan-comments.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec eslint hooks/use-message-handler.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:ratchet)
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check
```

Use the repository's exported `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs` `validateCoverage`
preflight with changed work orders and their linked plan/requirement/design
contents; record accepted cross-references. No new browser/mobile E2E is needed:
the only frontend change builds the same agent prompt for all viewports and
has no rendered or viewport-dependent behavior.

## Dependencies

Task 01 must pass before advertising range arguments.

## Risks

- Prompt changes must not replace or weaken hard workflow rules.
- A current version from a partial read protects a write but does not establish
  that the agent understands the whole plan; full-context tasks still need it.
- Cached schemas must refresh; guidance must respect discovered capabilities.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/tasks/requirements/plan-partial-reads.md), `003`.
- [Design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/plan-partial-reads.md), read/edit flow
  and guidance/public documentation.
- Existing `buildDocumentContext`, sysprompt tests, and public plan-write guides.
- Backend/web `AGENTS.md`, `/docs-maintainer`, and mobile-parity assessment.

## Results

Completed in the primary session after Task 01 passed.

- Guidance regression tests were added before prompt implementation and failed
  against the old guidance. The new fragment instructions passed those tests.
- The existing context-size guard initially caught excessive prompt growth.
  Compact wording now keeps the task template at 2,699 bytes, below the unchanged
  2,800-byte guard, and preserves the workflow/delegation/marker rules.
- The complete `internal/sysprompt` suite passed with `-trimpath`.
- Both document-context Vitest files passed: 47 tests across two files.
- Prettier, ESLint for the changed hook and test, and `i18n:ratchet` passed.
  The existing agent-only prompt exemption remains applicable.
- Public-doc validator tests passed (62 tests); validation passed for 47 pages.
- Catalog validation, all-spec lint, and 36 spec-linter tests passed.
- The complete affected MCP server, handler, plan WebSocket bridge, and contract
  package suites passed with `-trimpath`.
- The paired specs and implementation plan were promoted to their delivered
  states. Actual changed-file documentation coverage passed for both work
  orders and their linked requirements, design, and plan. Commit hooks run
  during delivery.

No rendered UI or viewport-dependent behavior changed. The shared prompt-builder
unit coverage exercises the frontend change; no browser/mobile E2E was added.

PR review follow-up: guidance now explicitly maps the first response's `version`
to the next request's `expected_version`. New backend/frontend assertions failed
before the correction, then the complete sysprompt suite and 47 hook tests
passed. The public tool table remains contiguous after moving the explanatory
paragraph below its final row. Public-doc, catalog, and spec validation passed.
