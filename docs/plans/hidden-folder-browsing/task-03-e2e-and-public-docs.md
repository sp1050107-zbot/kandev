# Task 03: End-to-end coverage and public documentation

## Summary

Prove the user-visible outcome through a real directory browser, and make the
public documentation match what ships. A hidden directory that a user can reach
in the product but not find in the docs is still a gap.

## Scope

- A desktop Playwright spec that opens a real directory browser, activates the
  control, sees a hidden entry, enters it, and selects it.
- A separate mobile Playwright spec for the coarse-pointer target and pinned
  slot, plus narrow fine-pointer coverage in the desktop spec.
- A public documentation update for the control, in the page that already
  documents the browser folder picker and the repo-less starting folder.
- Confirmation that the spec asserts the default-off listing too, so the
  no-regression case is covered by the same journey.

## Exclusions

- No new test project and no change to the E2E shard budget.
- No detailed native-picker instructions, symlink browsing, or tilde handling.
  Public docs state that the native picker uses the operating system's control.
- No production or test code change unless a failure here proves a defect, which
  is reported rather than absorbed.

## Implementation acceptance conditions

1. The desktop-width spec shows a home listing with no hidden entry, activates
   the control, sees the hidden entry, enters it, and confirms the selected
   path is the hidden directory's canonical path.
2. The phone-width spec shows the control meeting the coarse-pointer target and
   remaining in the pinned slot while the breadcrumb scrolls.
3. The public documentation states the control's existence and default for
   in-app directory browsers. It names the native-picker exception.

## Verification commands

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm e2e:run e2e/tests/task/directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts
pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome e2e/tests/task/mobile-directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts
pnpm run i18n:check
cd ../..
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
```

## Likely files

- `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/mobile-directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/mobile-add-workspace-sources.spec.ts` for the existing
  folder-picker journey helpers
- `docs/public/desktop-app.md`, and the public task documentation that covers
  the repo-less starting folder

## Dependencies and risks

- This work order depends on tasks 01 and 02; an end-to-end failure before both
  land is expected, not a defect.
- Local runners enforce one worker per shard and a memory-aware shard budget, so
  this spec runs in the existing task shard rather than a new project.
- The public documentation must not claim symlink browsing or tilde expansion.
  If the docs page turns out to describe the browser in a way this change
  contradicts, update the requirement rather than the sentence.

## Results

Done.

Two specs were written rather than one, because the `mobile-chrome` Playwright
project only collects `mobile-*.spec.ts`, and a phone test in a desktop-named
file would have been measured at desktop geometry.

Verification:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm e2e:run e2e/tests/task/directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts` | 4 passed |
| `pnpm e2e:run --project mobile-chrome e2e/tests/task/mobile-directory-browser-hidden-folders.spec.ts` | 2 passed (Pixel 5) |
| `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` | installed the build this Playwright version expects (1228); the cached 1243 was not usable |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | clean |
| `pnpm exec eslint` on both specs | clean |

The mobile spec first failed waiting for `files-workspace-actions`, because a
phone opens Files as a drawer from its own button and uses a drawer rather than a
dialog. The navigation was corrected against the proven
`mobile-add-workspace-sources` flow.

The desktop specs assert the default-off listing, the reveal plus re-list, entry
into the hidden directory, and sequential Tab access to the switch. A narrow
fine-pointer case checks the 44px target and a center click. The mobile spec
checks the coarse-pointer target and a touch-driven reveal.

All six E2E cases wait for `primary_executor_type` before opening the picker.
This prevents the Add folder action from racing task setup.

Code review found that the plan's UI-01 claim, "the breadcrumb scrolls while the
control stays fixed", was not proven by any test. A second phone case now walks
a seven-segment path and asserts the control stays flush against the popover's
trailing edge, that the breadcrumb genuinely overflows and scrolls, and that
there is no document-level horizontal overflow. That case first failed while
measuring an animating popover, which reports a narrower box and a scaled
control; it now waits for finite animations and asserts the trailing gap is zero
rather than merely unchanged.

Public documentation: `docs/public/tasks-and-workflows.md` describes the control
next to the source table, and `docs/public/desktop-app.md` distinguishes the
in-app browser from the operating system picker. Neither mentions symbolic-link
browsing or tilde expansion.
