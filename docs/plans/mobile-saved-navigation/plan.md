# Mobile saved navigation

## Successor

[Navigation hierarchy](../navigation-hierarchy/plan.md) deliberately proposes
replacing this package's tasks-before-tools order while preserving saved
visibility, relative tool order, setup, and plugin deduplication. The completed
results below describe the earlier requirement. New work and updated order
assertions belong to the successor package.

## Overview

Restore the phone menu hierarchy after the first sidebar customization. The user
requested unattended implementation through a PR with seeded screenshots, so this
package records the work within the authorized delivery session.

## Root cause and scope

`useHasSavedSidebarLayout` switches rendering at revision greater than zero.
`AppNavSections` inserts the entire saved layout before `afterPrimary`, moving
workspace tools ahead of Tasks. Built-in sections also reuse `ShortcutSection`'s
icon strip instead of the phone disclosures and omit setup/recovery paths.

Keep the shared drawer, saved layout data, domain availability, task controller,
desktop composition, and custom shortcut actions. Correct phone ordering, reuse
native built-in disclosures, and preserve labelled setup and navigation paths.
No backend, new preference, credential, or task-lifecycle changes.

## Mobile design contract

The hamburger opens the shipped `AppNavSheet` inset drawer for a temporary
navigation choice. Home/quick actions lead into the existing task list; optional
workspace tools follow. Tasks is the primary navigation action. The fixed header,
dynamic viewport bounds, one content scroller, safe-area padding, and 44px touch
targets remain. Desktop shares layout state while retaining its own composition.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-01: phone menu after saving a sidebar toggle, entered from Home or a task.

```text

  [unlabelled icon strip]      Integrations >
Tasks v                  +    [custom groups]
[task rows below fold]         Utilities

Expanded Integrations:
Integrations v
  [GitHub icon] GitHub
  [GitLab icon] GitLab
  Integration settings
```

Header stays fixed; all content shares one scroller. Section ordering and named
links are requirements; spacing is illustrative. Empty integrations show settings.
UI-02: desktop retains saved nodes/groups above Tasks and existing icon shortcuts.

## Tests and E2E

`settings/mobile-sidebar-customization.spec.ts` covers saved Home visibility,
first toggle save, task-before-tools order, labelled integration links, setup,
touch containment, scroll ownership, and task navigation (AC-UI-MOBILE-MENU-007.2,
007.3, 007.4 and AC-UI-SIDEBAR-CUSTOMIZATION-005.5).
Existing mobile menu hierarchy/integration and desktop customization tests cover
default layout, quick actions, launch handoff, and unchanged desktop behavior.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Restore saved phone navigation](task-01-restore-phone-navigation.md)
- [x] [Task 02: Consolidate mobile plugin navigation](task-02-consolidate-plugin-navigation.md)

## Verification results

Implemented with regression-first Playwright coverage. Saved layouts now compose
Home and quick actions, Tasks, then workspace tools. Built-in disclosures retain
setup and recovery actions; regular task menus use the existing create button.
The legacy Canvas block defers to the saved layout, including hidden Canvases.

Validation: 16 mobile regressions, 3 desktop regressions, and 58 focused unit tests
passed. Typecheck, focused ESLint, localization checks, docs catalog/spec checks,
and harness validation passed. See the work order for exact commands and results.

Seven screenshots use this branch's production build and a disposable mock-backed
workspace with four seeded tasks and GitHub/GitLab integrations. Captures cover
393px dark/light Tasks and Integrations, 360px and 767px phones, and 1280px desktop.
PR publication and exact-head CI/review status are tracked in the PR.

The user subsequently requested consolidation with PR #3889. Task 02 records
the combined 22 mobile, 3 desktop, and 77 unit checks plus nine replacement
screenshots with an installed, functional demonstration plugin. The new capture
uses clean implementation commit `7de0b0f9c` and supersedes the original images.

## Risks

- Plugin links must not duplicate or bypass saved visibility.
- Hidden Home must retain quick actions; task selection must retain its controller.
- Mobile section expansion must not introduce another vertical scroll region.
