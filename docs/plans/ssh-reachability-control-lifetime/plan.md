# Implementation Plan: SSH reachability control lifetime

## Overview

Keep settings load errors and pending probe controls with their committed
executor visit. One sequential work order adds transport-boundary regressions,
repairs the existing hook, and verifies real provider/card behavior. ROOT reviewed the four-file package and released implementation in the same
primary session. Task 01 is implemented; hosted delivery and merge remain
separate checkpoints.

The executor system owns this vertical correction because executor availability
and its settings controls already belong to
[REQ-EXECUTORS-SSH-REACHABILITY-002](../../specs/executors/requirements/ssh-reachability.md).
Criteria .3, .5, .6 and .10 remain unchanged. Added .13 and .14 specify the
missing visit-local lifetime and pending-control behavior. The paired
[design](../../specs/executors/system-design/ssh-reachability-surfaces.md#local-settings-request-lifetime)
defines the implementation boundary. No new feature, UI requirement or ADR is
needed: this is a local correction using an established lifecycle pattern.

## Confirmed evidence and root cause

At inspected HEAD `c373ba436c3451f046acd921d5de9a081977a2a7`, the hook,
card and API blobs match ROOT's proof base
`05c41b11e830a9861534200949c3bbac473b57f7` exactly:

| File | Blob |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web/hooks/domains/settings/use-ssh-reachability.ts` | `96befd84b37a17185572582dabf251c3d31420b0` |
| `apps/web/components/settings/ssh-reachability-card.tsx` | `802d655f88df15515975effc56fb4b4b40edd4e5` |
| `apps/web/lib/api/domains/ssh-api.ts` | `946ff3eac3dab344b53f341240ba676bb499be7f` |

The hook resets `seqRef` to zero on executor switch. Deferred A GET sequence 1
can therefore match B GET sequence 1 and publish A's load error under B.
`probeNow` has no lifetime guard, and the switch never resets `probing`, so A's
pending probe disables B's actual rendered action. Success/catch/finally and
retained actions also lack committed store/instance ownership.

Accept the independently authored proof without replay, copying/importing it
as permanent tests, mutation or deletion:
`/tmp/kandev-root-ssh-reachability-lifetime-next-candidate.test.tsx`, readonly
0400, SHA256 `17a23ee87a6f7986e254b331c72cd9809a5f9951ad609f9f908beeeb6f0dd22a`;
classification `/tmp/kandev-root-ssh-reachability-proof-classification.json`.
ROOT reports original32379/f058d2/369042 ACTUALLYJOINED exit 1 at 18:58:19Z,
6.141s: two causal failures, two positive controls PASS (current GET failure
renders not-known; own pending probe disables until completion). Real
`StateProvider`/AppStore, hook, card and SSH APIs ran with a transport-only
partial `fetchJson` mock. Scratch and owned processes are reported gone.
This package's source inspection independently confirms the same cause; it
does not claim a new reproduction run.

## Scope

### In scope

- Existing hook's committed executor/store/instance lifetime; initial/cadence
  load and probe admission, success, catch, finally and retained callbacks.
- Current-visit errors and pending controls, preserving keyed store evidence.
- Meaningful deferred-response tests through real hooks/provider/card/API,
  including cleanup before passive effects and same-executor positive controls.
- Strict RFC3339 completion/success timestamps in the hook clock and immediate
  card, with existing missing-time fallbacks (later ROOT review correction, .15).
- Exact focused checks, coverage mapping, normal hooks and gated delivery.

### Out of scope

- Store shape, `updated_at` reconciliation, HTTP/WS contracts or producers.
- Backend/remote probe cancellation, coalescing, completion, persistence,
  security, launch gating, feature defaults or staleness cadence.
- Generic ownership frameworks, global error/retry policy or unrelated hooks.
- New markup, UI copy, layout, navigation, touch geometry or breakpoints.
- Delegation, new tasks/sessions/tabs, proof replay, main-only rebases,
  synthetic tests, bypassed gates or foreign-resource cleanup.

## Technical approach

Reuse the local committed-callback and `useLayoutEffect` cleanup pattern from
`apps/web/hooks/domains/office/use-routing-preview.ts`; consult
`use-session-search.ts` for identity-separated visits. Keep it inside
`useSSHReachability`, using one committed identity and non-reused generation
per lifetime. Check admission before issuing transport and settlement before
every local/store write. Reset local controls on commit; never clear store
records or mutate an active ref during render. Keep the latest GET request
guard and independently owned current probe pending admissions. A retired
finalizer cannot clear current pending controls, and a prior A visit cannot
revive after A-to-B-to-A or StrictMode replay.

Obsolete hook HTTP results are dropped, while separately admitted HTTP and WS
evidence still reconciles by executor key and `updated_at`. Preserve current
success/error behavior and store timestamp arbitration. No new ordering policy
between GET and probe is part of this fix. Admitted transports continue to
settle; retiring a hook never aborts or changes a backend probe.

Existing package `ssh-host-reachability` has eight completed work orders and
records its original container E2E evidence. It has no pending lifetime repair;
its historical results/counts are unchanged. This package owns the new
regressions and validation results, referencing the same authoritative pair.

## ASCII UI preview

UI-01: Settings > Executors > SSH, navigating A to B while A is pending.
The existing card renders its existing localized text. Labels below describe
states; they add no product copy.

```text
Before: B visit inherits A work      After: B controls belong to B
+--------------------------------+ +--------------------------------+
| Reachability [Probe now: off]   | | Reachability [Probe now: on]    |
| A load rejection: not-known    | | B record, or B not-known only  |
+--------------------------------+ +--------------------------------+
                                    B starts its own probe:
                                   +--------------------------------+
                                   | Reachability [Probe now: off]   |
                                   | B's accepted record retained   |
                                   +--------------------------------+
```

Desktop places the action beside the heading. Phone uses the existing
`SettingsCardHeader` column, placing it below the heading. There is no new
fixed region or scroll owner. Required change: current visit alone determines
error/pending state (criteria .13/.14); spacing is illustrative. State remains
text, existing touch controls remain intact, and no viewport-dependent logic
changes. Targeted real rendered component tests satisfy `/mobile-parity`'s
pure state/data exception; no new mobile Playwright or geometry check is needed.

## Tests and acceptance coverage

Write new tests independently; do not copy the ROOT proof. Prefer one new
`apps/web/hooks/domains/settings/use-ssh-reachability.lifetime.test.tsx`
containing a small real-hook reader, real provider/store capture and rendered
card flows. Partial-mock only `@/lib/api/client::fetchJson` using `importOriginal`;
real SSH GET/POST functions must run and request paths/methods must be asserted.
Existing card, store and API suites stayed in the initial focused run. Later
review corrections run only affected lifetime/timestamp/card suites; independent
store/API results remain historical. Timestamp cases use the same real boundary
in `use-ssh-reachability.timestamps.test.tsx` to respect the test-file line limit.

| Criteria | Proposed named regression groups and assertions |
| --- | --- |
| .13, .10 | `retired initial load cannot mark B not-known`, `retired refresh cannot publish after A-B-A`: defer A and B, settle obsolete success/reject in both orders; inspect local error, rendered host/state and each keyed store record. |
| .13 | `retained load/probe actions are inert after commit cleanup`: invoke captured callbacks from layout cleanup/commit before passive effects; assert zero extra GET/POST and no state writes. Include pending settlement after unmount and same-executor remount/StrictMode replay. |
| .13, .14 | `StrictMode action admission`: a first-setup action demonstrably admits a POST, then cannot admit again after same-scope replay; the live replay action independently probes, disables and presents success. |
| .14, .5 | `B can probe while A is pending`: actual B card button is enabled, click it, assert POST targets B, B disables during its own probe, A finally cannot release B, then B settles and re-enables. Include obsolete probe success/reject. |
| .13, .14 | `independent owners keep independent controls`: same/different executors within one store and separate real providers; retiring one cannot mute another's success or pending state. |
| .3, .13 | `accepted keyed evidence survives retirement`: seed or push newer A/B records through real store action, settle obsolete HTTP, and assert records remain; current older success cannot overwrite newer record/reset but clears its own error. |
| .10, .14 | `current load/probe failures and success remain visible`: initial and refresh failure without a record shows not-known, cached record remains on failure, own success clears error and renders fields; newest same-executor refresh supersedes older failure/success. Overlapping current probe finalizers keep action disabled until own admissions settle. |
| .15 | `SSH reachability wire timestamps` and `independent reachability timestamp fields`: malformed shape/calendar dates cannot arm a stale timer or claim ages; valid UTC/offset/fractional/pre-epoch times retain the exact millisecond boundary; valid sibling age/state/store evidence remains. |
| .4, .11, .12 | Existing card cadence/staleness, translated record/state and shared viewport controls stay unchanged; record concrete passing test names in Results. |

Use deferred promises, React `act`, scoped rendered assertions and captured
real store APIs; settle every deferred test request and clean timers. Tests must
exercise public consumers and causal outcomes rather than mirroring an owner
predicate or hiding the race with immediately resolved mocks.

## E2E evidence and public documentation

Existing `apps/web/e2e/tests/ssh/reachability.spec.ts` in project `containers`
proves the broader SSH feature against a real sshd; its original plan records
two passing cases. It is historical evidence, not newly run proof of this race.
The new real hook/provider/API/rendered-card boundary tests prove this local
correction; no Docker/backend rebuild or broad E2E run is required.

Docs audit searched `docs/public`, root `README.md`, `docs/screenshots.md`,
specs and decisions for SSH/reachability/control wording. The explanation in
`docs/public/executors.md` already describes per-executor state and Probe now;
`docs/public/configuration.md` describes unchanged interval semantics. No public
docs/screenshots/copy change is needed. Internal owning docs are amended.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Bind local SSH reachability controls](task-01-bind-local-controls.md)

Sequential. No dependency work order, no delegation.

## Verification results

Design documentation checks passed on 2026-10-06:

- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: 357 decisions and 1408 specifications,
  exit 0 (original handle `99073e`).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: 36 tests, exit 0 (`ac0433`).
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: all specification files passed,
  exit 0 (`82d037`).
- `git diff --check`: exit 0 (`f8fda1`).

All four commands completed synchronously; no running process handle remains.
Exactly the existing requirement/design pair and this manifest/order changed.
Requirement size is 19,939 bytes, below its 20 KiB limit. Design is 16,366 bytes,
below its 32 KiB limit. Owning specs are active/current; Task 01 is done following ROOT review/release.

Implementation checks passed on 2026-10-06: 63 focused tests (27 new lifetime
cases), changed ESLint, format check, project typecheck, i18n check/ratchet,
catalog and spec lint, 36 spec-linter tests, 62 public-doc validator tests,
47 public pages and diff check. Exact commands and coverage are in
[Task 01 results](task-01-bind-local-controls.md#results). All originals are
ACTUALLYJOINED with owned groups gone; receipts/logs remain privately under
`/tmp/kandev-child58`. Normal commit/push/ready PR and hosted gates follow in
this primary session; merge requires ROOT's later serial interrupt.

PR #4272 review corrections add real fresh-to-stale and retired-clock coverage,
then bind callback admission to its producing committed generation after a
faithful same-scope StrictMode replay RED. The live current-action positive
control passed independently. All 43 affected lifetime/card cases and changed
lint, project typecheck, i18n and documentation checks pass after the generation
correction. Independent store/API results above are preserved historical
evidence; those suites were not replayed. Task 01 records exact causal findings,
coverage and private receipt locations. The same original hosted observer
follows the corrective heads; hosted completion and merge remain pending.

The bounded timestamp correction adds eight transport/provider/card cases:
four malformed-wire cases causally fail against the published code and four
valid timestamp controls pass. Final GREEN passes all 51 affected lifetime,
timestamp and card cases. Changed ESLint, project typecheck and i18n pass;
`BigInt(...)` preserves the project's existing target compatibility. The same
owning pair adds .15 and records independent existing age fallbacks. Catalog,
specification lint, formatting and normal delivery receipts are recorded in
Task 01. No unrelated store/API or backend/E2E replay is required.

## Risks

- Passive-only cleanup or render-time ref mutation leaves commit-boundary gaps.
- Executor ID equality alone revives old A work after A-to-B-to-A.
- A single pending boolean can be cleared by another request's finalizer.
- Mocking the hook/API/provider can conceal real store/card wiring failures.
- Shared-store evidence must remain independent of local controls.
- Setup/resource/timeouts or out-of-scope unknown failures require a ROOT
  checkpoint, not blind retries, cache wipes or foreign-process termination.
