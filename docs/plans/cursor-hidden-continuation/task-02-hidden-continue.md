# Task 02: Dispatch hidden continuation after completed tools

## Summary

Admit a new internal `continue` turn after supported transient provider errors
and successful completed foreground tools. Reuse the existing dispatch-only
continuation, native identity, retained runtime, episode, and cancellation paths.

## In scope

- TDD V2 ordered completion ledger and immutable wire snapshot, preserving V1
  read-only semantics and fail-closed old/unknown helper behavior. Include
  successful shell/write/MCP outcomes, resolved allowed permissions, mixed
  pending outcomes, invalid transitions, bounds, and pre-sweep snapshot ordering.
- Generalize continuation cause admission to the shared short-retry predicate
  including Task 01's resource category. Keep the original replay evidence fence.
- Set the literal payload to `continue`, without task-specific augmentation,
  original prompt, attachments, prompt caching, or user-message/history insertion.
- Keep one five-attempt episode, strict same-native restore, usable runtime reuse,
  human queue priority, supersession, exact-generation fencing, and settlement.
- Update mock recognition to literal `continue` only when its native session has
  an owned recovery fixture episode. Ordinary user `continue` stays ordinary input.

## Out of scope

New provider implementations, default-on rollout, public UI controls, hiding
messages by text, retrying ambiguous prompt acceptance, any fresh-session fallback,
and original-prompt replay after completed work.

## Acceptance

- V2 output plus all-successful foreground shell/write/MCP work receives exactly
  `continue` in the same native session. Mixed/uncertain outcomes and unknown
  support dispatch nothing. V1 remains limited and original replay stays fenced.
- Internal recovery creates an accepted turn with observable output and status,
  but no user-message or prompt-index row and no augmentation. An explicit human
  `continue` remains visible. Actual transport payload and repository history
  assertions prove this independently of the mock's success text.
- Repeated accepted failures and pre-dispatch restoration failures share the
  existing five-attempt backoff. Cancellation, new human work, archive/delete,
  config changes, backend restart, and ambiguous acceptance cannot duplicate work,
  reset the budget, or stop/settle a successor. Disabled mode derives no V2 evidence.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 -race ./internal/agentctl/server/adapter/transport/acp ./internal/agentctl/types/streams ./internal/orchestrator/watcher -run 'Test(CursorContinuationEvidence|ContinuationSafetySnapshot|ContinuationConfig)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 -race ./internal/orchestrator -run 'Test(InterruptionContinuation|PromptAttemptEvidence|HandleTransientFailure.*Replay)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 -race ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'Test(ContinuationNativeOnlyRestore|Retained.*Continuation)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -tags fts5 -race ./cmd/mock-agent -run 'Test.*Continuation' -count=1)
git diff --check
```

Add `TestInterruptionContinuationCompletedTools` and
`TestInterruptionContinuationHiddenContinue` beside existing admission/dispatch
tests. Run each behavioral regression RED before changing production behavior.
Native readiness and complete desktop/phone proof are required by Task 03.

## Dependencies

Task 01 complete. Read the completed-tool ADR, amended continuation artifacts,
runtime continuity requirements, and existing native compatibility evidence.

## Risks

Completion permits a new turn, not repeatability of a prior action. No instruction
can guarantee model idempotency. Never loosen V1 or fabricate provider completion
from prompt-end sweeps. Track unresolved permissions separately from generic event
serialization and explicit cancellation intent.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Design sections: Compatibility and evidence; Admission; Internal dispatch;
  Episode ownership and settlement; Rollout.
- Existing continuation ownership, budget, managed-input, retained-runtime, and
  restart tests; Tasks prompt-index/message projection as visibility evidence.

## Results

Task completed. Introduced native_saved_history_completed_tools_v2 support with bounded completion ledger admitting all successfully completed foreground tools (reads, writes, execute, MCP). Set internal continuation instruction to exact text "continue". Generalized continuation admission to all short-retryable transient provider errors. Added TestInterruptionContinuationCompletedTools and TestInterruptionContinuationHiddenContinue. Review remediation rejects Cursor subagent/background raw payloads and mixed
unknown/pending outcomes. Permission ownership follows the original turn;
approved tools become eligible only after completion, regardless of notification
ordering, while denied, cancelled, or unresolved requests remain ineligible.
Focused race tests pass.

PR review remediation narrows resource exhaustion to its verified complete
envelope, anchors unavailable/stalled categories, rejects the Cursor subagent
title alone, and refuses continuation after a prompt-gate handoff because late
permission/tool frames cannot prove originating ownership. Mock episodes are
consumed once. V1 positive admission/dispatch coverage remains; the lifecycle
fixture asserts a valid stored diagnostic. Reload checks wait for persisted
content, disabled-mode traces admit only the original prompt, and the seeded
resource-exhaustion test claims presentation coverage only. Specification
statuses and public foreground/uncertain-work boundaries are synchronized.
Remote CI and review disposition remain pending until the final fixup snapshot.
