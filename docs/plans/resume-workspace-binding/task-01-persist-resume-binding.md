# Task 01: Persist the final resume binding

## Summary

Save the session's final environment and workspace binding after resume materialization.
Keep the credential boundary and guarded startup ownership intact.

## In scope

- Add `TestResumeSessionPersistsMaterializedWorkspaceBinding` in a new focused executor test file.
- Cover agent resume and workspace-only resume after an initially empty raw path.
- Capture immutable write values and verify the raw path through repository integration.
- Save the final binding after `persistTaskEnvironment` and before success or process startup.
- Cover final-write error, cancellation, changed environment, and replaced startup attempt with controlled gates.
- Cover a same-attempt transition to `RUNNING` or `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` while `LaunchAgent` returns, without accepting a replaced attempt.
- Preserve pre-credential `STARTING`, credential snapshots, rollback, and owned execution cleanup.

## Out of scope

Git source eligibility changes, UI markup, database backfill, live runtime mutations,
new schemas, and new public contracts.

## Acceptance

- Both resume modes persist the canonical final binding independently of the effective session projection or mutable mock pointer.
- An unsuccessful or superseded final write prevents agent startup and cannot alter the successor session or its execution.
- Existing credential-boundary ordering and canonical workspace tests pass.

## Verification

Run the new regression before production edits and record the expected failure.
Run these commands from the repository root after implementation:

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test -race -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator/executor -run 'TestResumeSession.*(MaterializedWorkspaceBinding|WorkspaceBindingPersistence|WorkspaceBindingSuperseded)|TestPersistTaskEnvironmentBindsCanonicalWorkspaceOnEverySuccessPath|TestResumeSession_PersistsStartingBeforeCredentialLease|TestResumeSession_PersistsStartingBeforeLaunch|TestResumeSession_PropagatesTaskEnvironmentPersistenceFailure' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -race -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator/executor ./internal/task/repository/sqlite -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -race -tags fts5 ./internal/orchestrator -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go run ./cmd/sqlguard ./internal)
(cd apps/backend && go test -race ./internal/persistence/storeconformance -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test -v ./internal/task/repository/sqlite -run '^TestPostgresUpdateTaskSession(WorkspaceBinding|ResumeState)IfCurrentAttempt$' -count=1)
git diff --check
```

The PostgreSQL tests use an isolated database and skip when
`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is not configured. Run them with an owned test
instance when available and report a skipped run separately from test coverage.
No new schema tag is expected.

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/executor_resume.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/executor_resume_workspace_binding_test.go` (new)
- `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/executor/executor_mocks_test.go` (only if required for immutable write assertions)
- `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/sqlite/session_workspace_binding_test.go` (new integration evidence)
- `apps/backend/internal/task/repository/sqlite/session.go` (only if the existing guarded operation is insufficient)

## Dependencies

None.

## Risks

State projection can conceal a missing raw write. The mock stores mutable
session pointers, so assertions must use copied write snapshots or raw database reads.
Final persistence must retain startup-attempt and recovery-claim ownership.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Canonical continuity requirement](../../specs/tasks/requirements/additional-session-workspace-reuse.md), criteria `002.1` and the existing admission boundaries.
- [System design](../../specs/tasks/system-design/additional-session-workspace-reuse.md), Persistence and projection.
- [Plan](plan.md), confirmed root cause and reproduction.
- Existing `executor_resume_test.go`, `executor_environment_workspace_test.go`, and guarded session repository writes.

## Results

Pre-implementation RED reproduced the missing raw path for agent resume and
workspace-only resume. The temporary reproduction was removed.

Passed:

- Focused executor race tests for materialized binding, superseded attempts,
  canonical environment binding, and credential ordering.
- Full orchestrator race suite, including cancellation, prompt acceptance,
  unarchive recovery, and idle-session focus coverage.
- Full executor and SQLite package race suites (`sqlite`: 259.492s), covering
  persistence failure, cancellation, and changed-environment rejection.
- Deterministic successor-attempt regressions for a rejected final binding with
  a transient diagnostic read error and for an ordinary final-write error.
- An owned-attempt state-advancement regression proves the final binding can
  retry from the observed active state while still rejecting terminal or
  replaced attempts.
- Attempt-fenced state and credential rollback, including preservation of
  successor fields and reservation ownership.
- Runnable PostgreSQL raw write/read-back tests for owned agent binding,
  workspace-only state guarding, replaced attempts, cancellation, rollback, and
  unrelated metadata preservation.
- `go run ./cmd/sqlguard ./internal`.
- Persistence store conformance race suite (`32.838s`).
- `make -C apps/backend build`.
- `git diff --check`.

The environment-gated PostgreSQL tests were invoked but skipped because no
owned test instance or `KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` was available. PostgreSQL
behavior therefore remains unexecuted locally. No schema change was required.

### PR review follow-up (2026-10-02)

The final workspace-binding write now runs in a transaction and checks both
the current and requested environment against an active recovery claim before
updating. SQLite coverage proves an unclaimed write is rejected with
`ErrBusy`, while the matching admitted claim can complete the write. A
PostgreSQL behavior test uses an isolated database and raw read-back checks for
the rejected and admitted writes, state, error, binding, and unrelated
metadata.

SQLite and PostgreSQL rollback coverage now also exercises an originally
absent Git credential snapshot and verifies rollback removes the key while
preserving the startup attempt and unrelated metadata. The executor fake now
matches the repository's no-row result for a missing session.

Passed after these changes:

- Full executor and SQLite race suites.
- Full orchestrator race suite.
- Backend build, SQL guard, and persistence store conformance race suite.
- Focused SQLite tests for recovery-claim admission and absent-snapshot removal.

The PostgreSQL behavior tests compile and are runnable, but were skipped because
`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is not configured in this environment. CI runs them
when its PostgreSQL test service is available.
