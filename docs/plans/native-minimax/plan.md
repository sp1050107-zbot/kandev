# Implementation Plan: Native MiniMax

## Overview

Deliver #3996 sequentially in the authorized unattended primary session. The
user explicitly authorized continuing through design, implementation, commit,
PR, review remediation and normal-policy merge without routine checkpoints.

## Scope

Native agent and subscription setup, dynamic native model catalog, profile
selection, terminal passthrough, isolated runtime metadata and public docs.
Exclude wrappers, new transports, Office routing and credential relocation.

## Technical approach

Add MiniMaxACP to agents and registry using mcode directly. Verify installation
with --version, pin the official npm install recipe, retain native ACP IDs and
translate only terminal model syntax. Reuse LoginAgent with localized region
selection, ACP sessionmodel, permission handlers and executor session mounts.

| Provider | Transport | Model shape | Behavior | Evidence | Unsupported fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MiniMax Code | native ACP | typed category=model, encoded provider/model/variant | native session selection | published 0.5.10 handshake, protocol fixture | visible error, no account fallback |
| MiniMax Code terminal | native CLI | provider/model#variant | decoded explicit profile model | argv tests | invalid input retained, native rejection |

## ASCII UI preview

UI-01: Settings > Agents > MiniMax (login required), shared desktop/phone content:

```text
MiniMax   [MCP] [Login required]
[Login] [New Profile]
  Sign in to minimax-acp
  [Choose Mainland China or Global]
  [selected full wrapped command; native terminal]
  [Done]
```

UI-02: Profile start model picker (authenticated native catalog):

```text
Profile: MiniMax M3
Start model: [MiniMax-M3 - thinking v]
[Save]
```

These are content previews. MiniMax login reuses the shipped quick terminal:
a bounded desktop dialog and full-screen phone surface, dynamic viewport
height, safe-area padding, a flexing terminal and a visible Done action. The
command preview wraps within its width. Existing profile model popovers
retain their touch selection and tap-outside dismissal behavior. AC-001.2,
AC-001.3 and AC-002.2 are checked by desktop/mobile rendered flows.

## Tests

Agent/registry tests map AC-001.1/2 and AC-002.1/2/3 and AC-003.1/2 to native
metadata, availability, argv and credential isolation. Protocol shape tests
exercise typed config models in shared adapter/utility code. Isolated native
probes establish initialize and unauthenticated behavior; mock endpoint probes
provide runtime evidence without claiming subscription access.

## E2E tests

`settings/minimax-agent.spec.ts` (chromium) and
`settings/mobile-minimax-agent.spec.ts` (mobile-chrome) cover localized login
help and selecting/saving encoded profile models using fixture capabilities.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Native MiniMax runtime](task-01-native-runtime.md)
- [x] [Task 02: Setup, protocol and documentation](task-02-setup-validation.md)

## Verification results

Implementation validation passed: affected Go packages and changed-package
lint; login unit tests, frontend typecheck/lint/i18n; desktop and phone login,
model selection/save/reload E2E; public docs and specification/harness checks.
Native 0.5.10 probes verified initialize, auth_required, model selection, text,
MCP tool execution, active cancel and subsequent load against an explicit local
BYOK endpoint. No subscription credentials were available; native policy did
not emit permission requests during the probe, so handler evidence comes from
shared ACP regression tests. Both implementation work orders are complete.
CI/review disposition and final merge evidence are tracked by
[PR #4110](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/4110) and Kandev task
`04d255ef-97fa-4d3c-9618-8abf0db8745c`.

## Risks

Published CLI requires a supported Node version and optional SQLite install
scripts. Subscription model discovery cannot be verified live without an account.
OAuth file copying is not portable because native credential keys include the
absolute auth-home identity. CLI and ACP model syntax differ.

## Review remediation validation

The setup work order now covers localized install/passthrough metadata, single
capability-probe ownership after profile login, complete phone command display,
and an actual native task using the saved model. Installation and task tests
use isolated executable fixtures; published CLI probes and live OAuth limits
remain recorded separately. Current-head remote review/check and merge evidence
is tracked in the persistent Kandev plan and PR #4110.

## UI-03: Login region choice

```text
Desktop: short dialog             Phone: inset bottom drawer
MiniMax account region            MiniMax account region
Choose subscription region.       Choose subscription region.
[Mainland China] [Global]          [Mainland China, 48px]
                                  [Global, 48px; safe area]
After choice: existing quick terminal with the selected full command.
```

The setup work order owns named command selection, rejecting unknown variants,
localized region selection and both viewport flows. The existing login endpoint
and permissions are reused. No subprocess starts before choice, and reopening
returns to choice. Required local checks include login endpoint/DTO/API tests,
frontend API serialization tests, both setup/native-task E2E flows and backend
module lint. Previous f8 remote results remain historical until the next head
finishes CI and automated review.

## Region conflict correction

AC-AGENTS-MINIMAX-001.2 requires the selected region to reach native login.
The existing one-session-per-agent manager returns the original session on a
second start regardless of argv. A Global request can therefore attach to a
CN login. Preserve that manager's ownership and reject mismatched variant argv
with HTTP 409; identical/default reconnects retain their prior behavior.

UI-04 (same terminal on desktop and full-height phone):

```text
Sign in: minimax-acp
[requested full command]
Another sign-in command is running. Close it before trying again.
[Done]
```

Work order 02 owns the handler guard, structured error-to-copy mapping and
regressions. RED uses the real login manager through HTTP, including same-region
positive controls and cross-region/default mixed cases. Frontend coverage
exercises the start callback with a structured conflict and unrelated error.
Both E2E flows verify same-command reuse, rejection and an unchanged live
original session. Run the affected Go packages/race tests, full backend module
lint, frontend regressions/type/i18n/lint, desktop/phone E2E, docs/spec checks.
No session is killed or replaced; there is no account or command fallback.
