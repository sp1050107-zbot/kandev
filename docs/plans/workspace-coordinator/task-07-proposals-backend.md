# Task 07: Proposals Decided, Backend (WP-5a)

## Summary

Add the approve and reject route handlers (task 01 declared their types) with
the claim, frozen spec, idempotent task creation, the reserved external-id
prefix and recovery, and publish `coordinator.updated` on every decision.
Needs only task 01's proposals table and store methods (plus the one
discovery method this work order adds): tests insert pending proposals
through the store. Runs in parallel with tasks 02, 03 and 04.

## In scope

- In the decisions registration function of `backendapp/coordinator.go`:
  approve (from `pending` or `failed`, optional edits with the absent, null
  and empty-string rules of the proposals design's Edits table, re-validated
  including the step-eligibility check from task 01 (an auto-start step or a
  step that has become a feeder of an auto-start step since propose is
  refused); a failed attempt's `final_spec_json` is the base of the next;
  a `failed` row whose external id already holds a task completes with that
  task without re-validation, or returns 409 when the body carries edits),
  the pre-create eligibility check that runs immediately before every create
  call (ineligible fails the row with no create),
  the create-outcome branches (`Created` then `SettleExternalID`,
  `FoundSettled`, `FoundUnsettled`, and any other settle error, which returns
  the error and leaves the row `approving` for the next recovery pass to
  retry, since the create already produced a real task), reject (from
  `pending` or `failed`, optional reason), zero-row
  completion re-read (200 with the current row, or 404 when the row is
  gone).
- Stale-claim recovery at startup and on approve only; a proposal list or get
  never writes. The startup recovery hooks into task 01's decisions
  registration function (its startup-pass hook slot), not into the shared
  pass's call site. As the proposals design's
  [Recovery](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/proposals.md#recovery)
  says, the startup pass uses `cutoff = T0`, not the two-minute rule. It
  finds rows through a new store method, `ListApprovingClaimedBefore(ctx,
  cutoff)` (`status='approving' AND claimed_at < cutoff`, ordered by
  `claimed_at` then `id`, every workspace, no limit, no new index), and
  handles them one at a time. A discovery error ends the pass; a row error
  is logged and the pass moves on. A read error after a re-claim leaves the
  row `approving` (500 for an approve request), never `failed`.
- The step-graph loader in `internal/coordinator/step_graph.go` (the
  proposals design's
  [No agent starts](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/proposals.md#no-agent-starts)):
  it reads a workflow's steps through the workflow service's
  `ListStepsByWorkflow` and maps them to `[]StepNode` for task 01's
  `EligibleStep`. Task 03 needs the same loader and runs in parallel: build
  it at that path if it is absent when this work order branches; whichever
  of tasks 03 and 07 merges second deletes its own copy and calls the one on
  `main`.
- The `coordinator-proposal:` external-id prefix refused in the task service:
  `CreateTask` without `AllowReservedExternalID`, and
  `ReleaseTaskExternalID`, at the HTTP and MCP task create entry points.
- `coordinator.updated` after every committed claim, re-claim, completion,
  failure and reject, and never on a zero-row write. Task 03 publishes on
  propose; together they satisfy `AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-004.3`.
- 403 for approve and reject without `workspace.manage`; readers keep list
  and get (task 01).
- Whichever of tasks 03, 04 and 07 merges last into task 03's no-turn-start
  table (`noTurnStartPaths` in
  `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/no_turn_start_test.go`, run by
  `TestCoordinatorConversationNoTurnStart`) adds the rows for the paths owned by the other two (task 07's
  proposal decisions and startup recovery here), so the table is complete
  regardless of merge order.

Reject is allowed from `failed` as well as `pending`, matching UI-03's failed
card. This departs from the source analysis plan (`implementation-plan.md`
revisions 9 and 10, outside this repository), which allows reject from
`pending` only, and is recorded in the
[proposals design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/proposals.md#reject).

## Out of scope

- Any UI (task 08).
- Undo (phase 2 log), other proposal classes, reply with a condition,
  automatic classes, expiry.

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

Screenshots: none. This work order is backend only; the proposal card
screenshots are cited by task 08.

Mockup scenario specs to port: none as Playwright (see the plan's
[Mockup scenario to repo test](plan.md#mockup-scenario-to-repo-test)); the
decision behaviour of `05-rule-on-a-proposal` is covered by the Go tests below
and ported as Playwright in task 08.

## Acceptance

- One approval creates exactly one ordinary task in the target step with no
  agent started, under double approval, approve/reject races, a crash after
  the claim and a crash after the create.
- A pending or failed proposal is rejected through the API; every other
  decision returns 409 with the current proposal.
- No caller other than the coordinator service creates or releases a
  `coordinator-proposal:` external id.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/coordinator/... ./internal/task/... -count=1
cd apps/backend && make lint
```

Go tests cover: double approve creates one task, as a sequential simulation
relying on the CAS's atomicity by construction (`WHERE id=? AND status IN
('pending','failed')` is a single conditional UPDATE, so a second caller
always matches zero rows regardless of interleaving) rather than task 03's
true concurrent-goroutine stress of the row-contention path, since this test
targets the application logic's branch on the CAS result, not the database
engine's lock behaviour; edits re-validated (an auto-start step refused, and
a step that became a feeder of an auto-start step, directly or through a
`pull_from_step_id` chain, since propose is refused even though it passed
task 01's eligibility check at propose time); each Edits table row (absent
unchanged, null 400 naming the field, empty title or workflow 400, empty step
uses the start step, empty repository clears it, a changed workflow without
a step resets to its start step), and edits to a failed attempt kept on the
next approve; each create outcome: `Created` settles and completes, identity
lost completes with the survivor, a settle not-found fails the proposal, any
other settle error leaves the row `approving` for the next recovery to
complete, `FoundSettled` and `FoundUnsettled` complete with the found task and
never settle or release it; `coordinator.updated` published once after the
completion, and not on a zero-row write; a coordinator deleted during an
approval returns 404 with the task kept; a proposal list or get never writes,
whatever the caller's scope, and returns rows as stored; the created task gets no
agent on a step whose `on_enter` has `auto_start_agent` (no
`auto_start_on_create` marker); crash after claim and after create recover to one
task, including when the target step's eligibility changed during the crash
window (the stale re-claim's `GetTaskByExternalID` lookup finds the task the
crashed attempt already created and completes with it instead of failing);
crash after claim, before create, with eligibility now failing, fails the
proposal without creating a task; a startup pass run less than two minutes
after a claim whose `claimed_at` is before `T0` recovers it, and one whose
claim is at or after `T0` is left alone; the startup pass handles several
`approving` rows in `claimed_at` then `id` order and continues past a row
whose re-claim or create errors; a lookup or step-graph read error after a
re-claim leaves the row `approving` with the new token and returns 500 to an
approve request; a read error before the claim returns 500 with the row
unchanged and nothing published; a deleted workflow at stale re-claim with no
task found fails the proposal; the step made ineligible between the claim
and the create (after step 2 passed) fails the proposal with "the target
step is no longer eligible" and makes no create call, and a step-graph read
error at that check leaves the row `approving` and returns 500; a slow
original claimer whose create commits after a stale re-claim failed the
proposal on ineligibility logs at warn with the proposal and task ids,
writes nothing, returns 200 with the `failed` row, and the task stays on its
board; the same slow claimer finding the row `rejected` (a manager rejected
the `failed` row first) logs at warn, writes nothing and returns 200 with the
`rejected` row; a reject of such a `failed` row leaves the task on its board
(task still present, same step, no agent); a later approve of such a
`failed` row with no edits completes with that same task (`Found*`, no
second task) even while the step is ineligible; a later approve of it with
edits returns 409 with the row, validates nothing and writes nothing; a
lookup error on a `failed` row returns 500 with the row unchanged;
the loader maps `is_start_step`, `allow_manual_move`, an `on_enter`
`auto_start_agent` action and `pull_from_step_id` to `StepNode`, and returns
an empty graph for a workflow with no steps; two readers of a stale claim, one wins, keeping the first
`final_spec_json` and `decided_by`; a stale original claimer's completion and
failure updates match no row (claim token); edits sent against an `approving`
row get 409; status is checked before edits (invalid edits against an
`approving` row get 409, an approve of an `approved` or `rejected` row whose
spec no longer validates gets 409, and a stale claim whose frozen spec no
longer validates is re-claimed without validation and fails at the create);
a claim, re-claim or reject that matches no row because the proposal was
deleted returns 404; a sequential simulation of a racing approve and reject
against the same `pending` row, relying on the shared CAS's atomicity by
construction as the double-approve test above does: whichever UPDATE commits
first leaves the row `approving` or `rejected`, and the other matches zero
rows and returns 409 with that row (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-003.3`); create
error to `failed` then approve again; reject
from `pending` and `failed`, 409 otherwise, status checked before the
reason (a 501-character reason on an `approved` row gets 409), and a
501-character reason on a `pending` and on a `failed` row gets 400 naming
`reason` with the row unchanged (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-003.4`); a reason
that is absent, JSON `null`, `""` or only whitespace stores SQL `NULL` and
returns `reject_reason: null`, a padded reason is stored trimmed, and a
non-string reason gets 400; a manager's `pending` list holding two stale
claims returns 200 with both rows exactly as stored, recovering neither, since
list and get never write, whatever the caller's scope; HTTP and MCP create
refuse the prefix, release refuses it, and the flagged internal create
succeeds; approve and reject by a reader get 403. These tests seed and assert
only this work order's own tables (coordinators and proposals seeded through
task 01's store); the `workspace.deleted` cascade that also removes proposal
and stall rows (`AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-006.1`) is task 04's subscriber
and its test, since task 07 does not depend on task 04.

## Likely files

- `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/{approve,reject,recovery,step_graph}.go` and tests
- `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/store_proposals.go` (`ListApprovingClaimedBefore` only)
- `apps/backend/internal/task/service/service_tasks.go`, `service_requests.go`, `external_id.go` (reserved prefix)
- `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/coordinator.go` (decisions registration function only)

## Dependencies

- Task 01 (proposals table, claim and settle store methods, types, event).
  While G0 is open the branch starts from task 01's branch and rebases onto
  main after each predecessor merges.

## Risks

- Recovery must never start a session; the no-turn-start table covers the
  recovery path.
- The task service's external-id idempotency must return the existing task
  rather than error; verify before relying on it.
