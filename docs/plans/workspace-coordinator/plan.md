# Implementation Plan: Workspace Coordinator, Phase 1

## Overview

Phase 1 ships the workspace coordinator's core flow behind
`features.coordinator`: coordinators in workspace settings, a sidebar entry per
coordinator, Needs you and Queue, an attended copilot that reads the workspace,
and task proposals a manager approves, edits or rejects. It is built only on
Kandev main's own building blocks.

The phase map, gates and decisions are in
[ADR-2026-09-26-workspace-coordinator](../../decisions/2026-09-26-workspace-coordinator.md).
This plan covers phase 1 only. Phases 2 to 5 are written to this depth before
their gates open.

## Order

Shared interface first, then parallel work. Task 01 lands the contract
(tables, types, route shapes, constants, event, client); every later work
order builds against it, so they run side by side.

```text
WP-0 --+--> G0 (gates opening upstream PRs, not building)
       +--> task-05 popover shell and chat props --------------------+
       +--> task-01 shared interface --+--> task-02 settings tab      |
                                       +--> task-03 session, surface -+--> task-06 copilot wired --> task-08 proposal UI
                                       +--> task-04 Needs you, Queue -+                                  ^
                                       +--> task-07 approve/reject backend -----------------------------+

task-06 --> task-09 conversation recovery --+
task-08 ------------------------------------+--> task-11 panel swap ---------+--> task-10 activity display
                                            +--> task-12 review follow-ups --+
```

Tasks 09 and 10 were added on 2026-09-28 from the real-agent check of the
integrated phase 1 build: a conversation whose agent failed to start could
never recover, and the transcript showed Kandev's session plumbing to a
business user.

Task 11 was added on 2026-09-28 from maintainer review of PR #3981: the
copilot is a right-side panel, not a popover. Tasks 05 and 06 are already
built as the popover and tasks 08 and 09 finish on it, so task 11 swaps the
popover for the panel after them, and task 10 builds on the panel.

Critical path: WP-0, task 01, task 03, task 06, task 08, task 11, task 10. At most three agents
build at once; tasks 03 and 04 go first, as the two largest. Parallel work
orders touch disjoint files except `internal/backendapp/coordinator.go`, where
task 01 gives each later work order its own named registration function
(conversation for task 03, subscribers for task 04, decisions for task 07).

**One PR.** Work orders are built and reviewed on their own branches, and
each passed branch is merged into one integration branch,
`coordinator/p1-integration`. Phase 1 ships upstream as one pull request,
[#3981](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/pull/3981), carrying this design
package and all of its code. The owner chose one PR on 2026-09-29: the
feature is flagged off in prod, the repository squash-merges, and one branch
avoids rebasing a dozen stacked branches after every merge.

**G0 gates merging, not building.** Building starts when WP-0 has passed
Review, not when it merges. The PR does not merge until G0 is met, as the
ADR's G0 Status section records. An objection at G0 re-plans the affected
work orders.

**Branches.** Tasks 01 to 10 started from their predecessors' branches, as
their Dependencies sections say. Tasks 11 and 12 start from the integration
branch. The integration branch merges `main` and the design package's branch
as they move; nothing is rebased onto `main` per work order.

| Work order | Package | Size | Depends on | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [task-01](task-01-shared-interface.md) | WP-1 | M | WP-0 | Every table, type, route shape, constant and event exists; CRUD, proposals read and stalls read work; flag off 404s |
| [task-02](task-02-settings-tab.md) | WP-1b | M | 01 | Coordinators added, edited and deleted in settings; flag off hides the tab |
| [task-03](task-03-session-tool-surface.md) | WP-2 | L | 01 | A coordinator session reads tasks and writes a proposal; no other write succeeds |
| [task-04](task-04-needs-you-queue-stalls.md) | WP-3 | L | 01 | Needs you and Queue render a real workspace; nothing writes |
| [task-05](task-05-popover-shell.md) | WP-4a | M | WP-0 | Popover shell and chat props exist; Configuration chat and task chat unchanged (built) |
| [task-06](task-06-copilot-wired.md) | WP-4b | M | 03, 04, 05 | A manager asks the coordinator about the workspace from the Coordinator screens, in the popover (built) |
| [task-07](task-07-proposals-backend.md) | WP-5a | M | 01 | A pending or failed proposal is approved exactly once or rejected through the API; recovery holds |
| [task-08](task-08-proposals-ui.md) | WP-5b | M | 06, 07 | Proposals approved, edited and rejected on both surfaces |
| [task-09](task-09-session-recovery.md) | WP-4c | S | 06 | A coordinator whose session ended shows recovery feedback, and Retry opens a fresh conversation |
| [task-11](task-11-panel-swap.md) | WP-4e | M | 08, 09 | The copilot is a right-side panel beside the list; the board preview is unchanged |
| [task-12](task-12-review-follow-ups.md) | WP-4f | M | 08, 09 | The maintainer review's race, stale claim, approval guard and item reference are fixed |
| [task-10](task-10-activity-display.md) | WP-4d | S | 11, 12 | The copilot panel shows a live status line and a collapsed tool chip; phase 1 complete |

Sizes: S under 1 day, M 1 to 3 days, L 3 to 7 days. Each work order is its own branch and review, keeps `prod` off, and ships its tests. Every acceptance criterion of the
four requirement documents is owned by exactly one work order's frontmatter;
where a criterion spans surfaces, the owner's body names the work orders that
build the other surfaces.

## Backend

- `internal/coordinator` (task 01): store (`coordinators`,
  `coordinator_proposals`, `coordinator_stalls`) with all store methods,
  repository, service, CRUD, proposals read and stalls read routes, types for
  every route, `coordinator.updated` and its forwarder. Wired in
  `internal/backendapp/coordinator.go`; the store is always initialised and
  everything else is behind the flag.
- Conversation, session and tool surface (task 03): `TaskOriginCoordinator`,
  `SurfaceCoordinator` and `mcpmode.Coordinator` at every resolution site,
  refusal of the origin at the HTTP and MCP create entry points,
  `IsRestorableQuickChatTask`, `autoResumeEligibility`, `message.add`
  requiring `workspace.manage` on a coordinator task,
  `registerCoordinatorTools`, the guard in
  `internal/mcp/handlers/coordinator_authorization.go`, the exact-name
  permission policy and `AutoApprovePermissionsOverride=false`.
- Stall and `workspace.deleted` subscribers and startup pruning (task 04).
- Approve, reject, recovery and the `coordinator-proposal:` external-id prefix
  refusal (task 07).

## Frontend

- Typed client (task 01); settings tab and pages (task 02).
- `lib/coordinator/attention.ts` classification, the Coordinator screens,
  sidebar entries and badge (task 04).
- `ChatPopoverShell` from Configuration chat, the optional
  `QuickChatSessionView` props and the transcript tag (task 05);
  `QuickChatSessionKind` stays `"chat" | "config"`.
- `RightSidePanel` extracted from the board's task preview
  (`kanban-with-preview.tsx`), with an opt-in mobile full-screen mode, and the
  copilot moved into it (task 11).
- The coordinator copilot controller, chip and store (task 06).
- Proposal store and card on both surfaces (task 08).

## ASCII UI previews

Structural choices are requirements; spacing and exact copy are illustrative.
All copy goes through `t()` in six locales. Components are Kandev's existing
primitives.

### UI-01: Needs you (entry: the coordinator's sidebar entry)

Desktop. The count strip is fixed above the scrolling list; the launcher is
fixed bottom right while the copilot panel is closed (UI-02 shows it open).

```

Phone at 390px. The strip stays in view; cards stack; actions wrap with 44px
targets; the coordinator entries are in the menu rows.

```

Criteria: `AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-002.*`, `003.*`, `006.*`, `008.1`.

### UI-02: The copilot (Coordinator screens)

A right-side panel, laid out like the board's task preview panel: full content
height, resizable from its left edge (default 500px), Close and no maximize.
It sits beside the list, which narrows, while the list keeps half the content
width; otherwise it floats over the list above a backdrop. Full screen on a
phone. The launcher is hidden while the panel is open.
Tasks 05 and 06 built the copilot as a popover first; task 11 delivers this
panel.

Criteria: `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.*`, `005.*`.

### UI-03: Proposal card states (Needs you and chat)

```text

Edit opens title, description, workflow, step (eligible steps only) and
repository in place, with **Approve with edits** and **Cancel**. Reject opens
an optional reason with **Confirm reject** and **Cancel**. Criteria:
`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-005.*`.

### UI-04: Empty and error states

## Mockup screenshots

The phase 1 screenshots from the analysis mockup (`shots-v2.1`) are carried
into [`assets/`](assets/). They are the visual reference; the acceptance
criteria govern, and the prototype banner, demo controls and `P1`/`WC-`
labels are mockup chrome.

| Screenshot | Shows | Cited by | Work orders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/p1-01-needs-you.png`](assets/p1-01-needs-you.png) | Needs you: strip, question, stall and error items, sidebar badge | needs-you, proposals, ADR | 04, 08 |

## Mockup scenario to repo test

| Mockup spec (phase 1 view) | Repo test | Work order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `18-v21` settings test | settings: add, edit, delete, permissions | 02 |
| `01-morning-check` | screens, strip, item card structure, sidebar entry | 04 |
| `06-stalled-child` (evidence) | stall card and evidence from a real `task.stalled` | 04 |
| `07-empty-is-success` | UI-04's three states | 04 |
| `14-first-run-setup` (uncoordinated part) | no coordinator: Inbox kept, generic entry, no strip | 04 |
| `18-v21` phase 1 list assertions | phase 1 kinds and actions only | 04 |
| `17-ask-the-copilot`, `18-v21` Ask about this | copilot, draft, answer | 06 |
| `05-rule-on-a-proposal`, `18-v21` "one write class" | approve, edit, reject on both surfaces | 08 |

Repo tests drive the mock agent with `e2e:` scripts and assert product
surfaces, not agent wording.

## Verification strategy

- Go tests beside the code in `internal/coordinator`, `internal/mcp`,
  `internal/agentctl`, `internal/task` and `internal/orchestrator`; store and
  upgrade conformance on SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- Vitest for `attention.ts`, the API client, the settings tab gating, the
  proposal store and the transcript renderer.
- Playwright in `apps/web/e2e/tests/coordinator/`, in the default project, the
  `auth` project for reader cases and `mobile-chrome` for 390px checks, with
  axe scans on the Coordinator screens.
- Every work order also runs `cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check` when it adds
  copy.
- Public docs `docs/public/coordinator.md` through `/docs-maintainer` land with
  task 08, including what the coordinator's agent can still do through its own
  tools.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| A maintainer prefers the plugin placement of ADR-2026-08-31 | G0 before any upstream PR opens; the ADR supersedes one clause openly and keeps the Host half; an objection re-plans the affected work orders |
| A tool slips past the guard | Task 03's table test walks every registered Kandev MCP action for a coordinator principal |
| The agent reaches past its Kandev surface through its own tools | Phase 1 is attended; the ADR records the residual; containment is a G3 condition |
| A `coordinator` surface, mode or origin name is taken on main when task 03 starts | Task 03 checks first and renames if taken (D7) |
| Open PRs touching `internal/mcp` land first | Whichever lands second rebases; no dependency either way |

## Definition of done (phase 1)

The flag is on in e2e; the tests above pass; task 03's tests prove the
coordinator's Kandev surface can only read and propose, that Kandev
auto-approves nothing else for it, and that nothing but a manager's message
starts a turn; public docs are updated.
