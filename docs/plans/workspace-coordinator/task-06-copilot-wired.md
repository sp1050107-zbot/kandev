# Task 06: Coordinator Copilot Wired In (WP-4b)

> **Built as a popover.** This work order is built. The popover frame it
> describes (420 by 550 pixels, the 1200px no-overlap check, Escape anywhere)
> is the interim state. The requirement now specifies a right-side panel, and
> [task 11](task-11-panel-swap.md) delivers it: it owns the panel criteria
> `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.1`, `004.2`, `004.7`, `004.8`, `004.11`,
> `004.12`, `004.13` and `002.4`, which this work order no longer owns. The
> content criteria listed below stay here, and task 11 keeps them passing.

## Summary

Put the copilot on the Coordinator screens: task 05's shell and
`QuickChatSessionView` on the session from task 03's conversation route, with
**Ask about this** and its context chip on task 04's item cards. On the
critical path.

## In scope

- Coordinator controller: launcher for `workspace.manage` only, busy state
  from the session store, 420 by 550 popover titled `Coordinator: <name>`, no
  Expand, full width below 640px. With the flag off no launcher renders.
- Launcher busy state as the
  [copilot design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-popover.md#launcher-busy-state)
  says: the controller never calls the conversation route on mount; the
  session id is the latest route response's in this page, else the primary
  session of the GET's `conversation_task_id` through `useTaskSessions`, kept
  subscribed with `useSession` while a Coordinator screen is mounted; busy is
  `isSessionWorking`; a null `conversation_task_id` or a failed read is not
  busy and fetches nothing.
- The controller's own coordinator read
  ([copilot design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-popover.md#coordinator-read)):
  `getCoordinator` when the viewed coordinator resolves and again on each
  popover open, before the route; no polling.
- The open sequence and its outcome table
  ([copilot design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-popover.md#opening-the-conversation)):
  one sequence in flight per coordinator, stale responses discarded, no
  automatic retry; GET and route 404 show the gone message, a GET failure and
  a route 502, 500, other status or network error show their message with
  **Try again**, `conversation_conflict` shows its message with **Try again**.
  No error body renders a composer or `SessionRecoveryFeedback`.
- The popover builds its `QuickChatSession` value from the conversation
  route's response with `kind: "chat"`, passes `archive_state` as
  `taskArchiveState`, `automaticRecovery={false}` and
  `hideSessionSelectors`.
- The copilot half of `AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-005.1` (owned
  by task 03): the profile messages in place of the composer, mapped from
  `agent_profile_status` and `executor_profile_status` as the
  [coordinators design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/coordinators.md#validation)
  tables say: from the coordinator GET without calling the conversation
  route, or from the route's `coordinator_profile_unavailable` 409 body;
  both messages shown together when both are not `ok`. A
  component test covers agent `missing`, agent `passthrough` (the passthrough
  message, not the removed one), executor `missing`, both not `ok`, a 409 body
  after an `ok` GET, and an unknown status value (shown as that field's
  `missing` message).
- Empty-conversation intro and one suggestion, the fixed translated "What
  needs me first, and why?", shown only while the transcript is empty; it
  replaces the composer text, sets no chip and sends nothing
  ([copilot design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-popover.md#empty-conversation)).
- Copilot store `{open, chip, draft}` in client memory, one entry per
  coordinator id, shared by Needs you and Queue, reset by a reload; a 404
  clears `chip` and `draft` at once, keeps the popover open on the gone
  message, and removes the entry when that popover closes; close keeps the chip, a send keeps the chip, `draft` is a one-shot
  seed cleared once applied
  ([copilot design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-popover.md#ask-about-this)).
- **Ask about this** wiring on task 04's item cards, the chip, and the
  "About <id>: " prefix through task 05's `transformOutgoing`, with the hint
  under the composer. `<id>` is the card's identifier, else task title, else
  the proposal title for a proposal without a source task, normalised
  (whitespace runs to one space, trimmed, each `: ` to ` - `); the question
  "Why is {{id}} here?" is translated, the `About ` prefix is not.
- Readers: **Ask about this** stays a disabled button with no handler and
  the translated tooltip "Only workspace managers can ask the coordinator."
- Screens leave room for the popover at 1200px.

## Out of scope

- The launcher on other pages, Expand, a Quick Chat tab (phase 2).
- Proposal decisions on the chat card (task 08; the card renders read-only).

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

Screenshots (visual reference; the acceptance criteria govern):

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png`](assets/p1-02-ask-about-this.png)
- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png`](assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png)

Mockup scenario specs to port (in the workspace-coordinator analysis
mockup's `mockup/e2e/tests/`, outside this repository; see the plan's [Mockup scenario to repo test](plan.md#mockup-scenario-to-repo-test)):

- `17-ask-the-copilot.spec.ts`: ask, answer, tool call shown.
- `18-v21-copilot-anywhere.spec.ts`, Ask about this: chip, draft, stored prefix and tag.

## Acceptance

- A manager opens the copilot, asks about an item and gets the mock agent's
  answer; the chip, draft, prefix and tag behave as specified.
- Opening, closing and reloading send no prompt, resume or restore request
  and start no turn; after a reload the transcript shows the session's state
  as stored: an idle session shows idle until Send, and a turn that kept
  running across the reload shows running with the launcher busy.
- Readers see no launcher; Escape, Stop, no send while a turn runs, and the 1200px and
  390px layouts pass; no Quick Chat tab appears.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm test -- hooks/domains/coordinator app/coordinator/copilot
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run i18n:check
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run tests/coordinator/copilot.spec.ts tests/settings/config-chat-popover.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project=mobile-chrome tests/settings/mobile-config-chat-popover.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project=mobile-chrome tests/coordinator/mobile-copilot.spec.ts
```

The `mobile-chrome` project matches on the `mobile-*.spec.ts` filename prefix
(`apps/web/e2e/playwright.config.ts`), not on project scope, so the 390px
layout assertions live in their own `mobile-copilot.spec.ts` file rather than
a rerun of `copilot.spec.ts` under a different project.

`tests/coordinator/copilot.spec.ts` includes a permission-request case: the
mock agent calls one of its own tools, the popover shows Approve and Deny
through `QuickChatSessionView`'s existing permission UI (unchanged by this
work order), and approving lets the tool call complete. This is the test that
pins `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.9` (task 03's, enforced by the guard and
auto-approval policy) for a coordinator session.

A component test on the coordinator controller asserts the flag-off case
directly: with `features.coordinator` off, no launcher renders on the
Coordinator screens, so the "In scope" summary's "no launcher renders" claim
is a checked assertion. A second component test covers the reader-visibility
case (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-004.1`) with the flag on: a `workspace.manage`
viewer sees the launcher on both Coordinator screens, and a `workspace.read`
viewer sees neither launcher, with no popover reachable by URL or keyboard.
Task 02's `tests/auth/coordinator-settings-reader.spec.ts` is the coordinator
suite's one `auth`-project Playwright spec; this reader-gating check does not
need a second one.

A component test on the open sequence covers each row of the design's
outcome table: GET with a status not `ok` (route not called), GET 404 and
route 404 (gone message, no **Try again**, popover still open with no chip until Close, then the entry is gone), GET 500 and network error, route
409 `coordinator_profile_unavailable`, route 409 `conversation_conflict`,
route 502 and 500. Each asserts no composer and no `SessionRecoveryFeedback`,
Close and Escape still work, and **Try again** re-runs the GET and then the
route exactly once. It also asserts that two opens in flight issue one GET
and one route call, and that a response for a coordinator no longer viewed is
discarded.

A component test on the launcher asserts: mount issues the GET and never the
conversation route; a null `conversation_task_id` shows not busy with no
session read; a `RUNNING` session, and a `background` foreground activity,
show busy with the popover closed; a session state change pushed while closed
flips the launcher; when the viewed coordinator changes from A to B and A's
GET resolves after B's, the launcher follows B's session and never subscribes
to A's.

A store and card test asserts: the `<id>` derivation for a task with and
without `identifier`, a proposal with and without a source task, and titles
containing a line break, repeated spaces and `: ` (the sent message parses
back to the whole id); a same-item re-ask replaces typed text with the
question; the chip survives close and reopen, a send, and Needs you to Queue
navigation, and does not appear on another coordinator; a reload starts
without a chip; the suggestion fills the composer without a chip or a send
and hides once a message exists; a reader's **Ask about this** is disabled,
shows its tooltip, and opens nothing.

## Likely files

- `apps/web/app/coordinator/copilot/`
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/coordinator/use-copilot.ts` and test
- `apps/web/src/locales/*/`
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/coordinator/copilot.spec.ts`, `mobile-copilot.spec.ts`

## Dependencies

- Task 03 (conversation route, attended session, mock agent tools).
- Task 04 (screens, item cards with **Ask about this**).
- Task 05 (shell, props, transcript tag).
- While G0 is open the branch starts from task 03's branch with the reviewed
  branches of tasks 04 and 05 merged in, and rebases onto main after each
  predecessor merges.

## Risks

- Tasks 03, 04 and 05 land in any order; start only when all three have
  passed Review, so the controller is built on their final interfaces.
