# Task 03: Coordinator Session, Tool Surface and Proposals Written (WP-2)

## Summary

Give each coordinator a conversation task and an attended session whose Kandev
surface can only read the workspace and propose tasks. `propose_task_kandev`
writes through task 01's store and publishes task 01's `coordinator.updated`.
Deciding proposals is task 07. Backend only. On the critical path.

## In scope

- First step: check main for a `coordinator` surface, mode or origin name, an
  `app/coordinator/` directory or a `/coordinator` route already taken (D7);
  rename in the design if one is.
- Conversation route handler (task 01 declared its types) in the
  conversation registration function of `backendapp/coordinator.go`: create
  once with `coordinator_id` metadata and no auto-start marker, race-safe
  including a failed loser cleanup and a racing coordinator delete, recreate,
  session ensured through `EnsureSession` with `AutoStart: &false` and
  `ActivationSource: session_open`, 502 on an ensure failure with the task
  kept, 409 with the `coordinator_profile_unavailable` body on a status other
  than `ok` from task 01's `profileStatus`; a zero-row update at step 4 whose
  re-read finds `conversation_task_id` NULL (a concurrent context change
  cleared it after the stale read in step 2) deletes the task just created
  and returns 409; the panel's next open retries with the fresh value; a
  context or profile change that archives the reused-or-just-created task
  between step 2 (or step 4's commit) and step 6's `EnsureSession` returning
  is caught by step 7's re-read, which also returns 409 rather than the now-
  archived task (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.9`).
- `TaskOriginCoordinator` (task 01's constant) refused at HTTP and MCP task
  create. The `coordinator-proposal:` external-id prefix refusal is task 07's.
- `ListCoordinatorOriginTasks` in the task repository (SQLite and PostgreSQL)
  and the startup conversation cleanup: delete tasks whose `coordinator_id`
  names no coordinator, archive unarchived tasks that are not their
  coordinator's current conversation, considering only tasks created before
  `T0`. This cleanup hooks into task 01's conversation registration function
  (its startup-pass hook slot), not into the shared pass's call site.
- Quick Chat idle expiry excludes origin `coordinator` in
  `ListExpiredQuickChatTasks` and `DeleteExpiredQuickChatTask`.
- Standing-instructions system block (`sysprompt`) and launch-prompt branch;
  a context change, or a changed `agent_profile_id` or `executor_profile_id`,
  archives the current conversation task and clears the reference
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-002.10`: a running session cannot move onto a
  different profile pair mid-session, so archiving is what makes a profile
  change take effect, the next open building a fresh task and session from
  the coordinator's current profiles); coordinator delete additionally
  removes every conversation task of the coordinator (current and archived).
- Every resolution site uses task 01's constants: `principalSurface`,
  the `CoordinatorLookup` interface (new here), the coordinator branches in
  `Executor.resolveTaskSessionMCPMode` and `resolveTaskSessionMCPProfile`
  (in the order of
  [copilot#principal-and-mode](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot.md#principal-and-mode),
  where "no row" is `errors.Is(err, repoerrors.ErrTaskNotFound)` or a nil
  task and any other `GetTask` error is a read error: `GetTask` first, a
  read error failing every session including config-mode ones; coordinator
  origin next, so a coordinator-origin task never takes config mode; then
  the no-row lookup; then config mode as today; then, with no row, today's
  per-form result (`ErrTaskNotFound` still fails, a nil task keeps
  `Legacy`)), the mode
  cases in
  `internal/mcp/server/server.go` and `Legacy` in
  `internal/mcp/profile/profile.go`, plugin tools skipped.
- `Coordinator` added to `mcpmode.instanceModes` (`IsInstanceMode`,
  `InstanceModes`) in `internal/common/mcpmode/mode.go`, and agentctl
  `handleSetMcpMode` (`internal/agentctl/server/api/server.go`) building its
  400 message from `mcpmode.InstanceModes()`.
- The conversation task stamps `agent_profile_id` and `executor_profile_id`
  metadata from the coordinator, the carriers `EnsureSession` and the launch
  path read ([copilot step 3](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot.md#conversation-task)).
- Dependency wiring as in
  [copilot#principal-and-mode](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot.md#principal-and-mode)
  (Wiring): new `internal/backendapp/coordinator_conversation.go` with
  `wireCoordinatorConversation(p routeParams)`, one call line in the existing
  `if p.features.Coordinator` block of `registerSecondaryRoutes` in
  `helpers.go`, `svc.SetConversationDeps` and `svc.SetConversationHooks`; the
  hook call site and `registerCoordinatorConversation`'s signature unchanged.
  The `CoordinatorLookup` is set at construction instead (Lookup wiring):
  `mcpscope.Resolver.SetCoordinatorLookup` and
  `orchestrator.Service.SetCoordinatorLookup` (forwarding to `Executor`),
  each guarded by `services.Coordinator != nil`, called in
  `startAgentInfrastructure` (`main.go`: its resolver after `NewResolver`,
  the orchestrator after `provideOrchestrator` and before startup recovery)
  and in `registerMCPAndDebugRoutes` (`helpers.go`: its resolver before
  `SetMCPPrincipalScoper`); the `handoff_wiring.go` resolver gets none.
- `registerCoordinatorTools` with the six tools built in phase 1's first cut
  (task 12 adds `get_coordinator_item_kandev`, the seventh tool of
  `AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-003.1`), reusing their existing handlers unchanged;
  `propose_task_kandev` (open-proposal cap under a per-coordinator lock)
  writing through task 01's proposal insert and publishing
  `coordinator.updated`; the `coordinator.propose_task` action; the guard in
  `coordinator_authorization.go`.
- Fail-closed start checks in the two executor resolvers (every launch,
  resume, interaction and prepare path), including the profile check at
  session start and the `CoordinatorLookup` by task id when the task row is
  absent, so the nil-task `Legacy` fallback never serves a coordinator task
  while the flag is on;
  exact-name auto-approval; `AutoApprovePermissionsOverride=false` on every
  lifecycle path. Promotion of a workspace-only execution goes through an
  executor launch or resume, so the resolvers and every fail-closed check run
  again there; nothing carries prepare's decision forward. A new `McpMode`
  field on `lifecycle.WorkspaceInfo`
  (`internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/types.go`), set by
  `GetWorkspaceInfoForSession` (`internal/task/service/service_turns.go`)
  from the task row alone (`coordinator` when the origin is `coordinator`,
  empty otherwise; a read error returns the error; no row, meaning
  `ErrTaskNotFound` or a nil task, leaves it empty with no error), carries the mode to the agentctl instances the lifecycle builds
  without the executor (workspace-only restore, admission), which start no
  agent; agentctl does not consult its own
  `cfg.AutoApprovePermissions` in this mode.
- `autoResumeEligibility` returns `coordinator_message_only`;
  `IsRestorableQuickChatTask` excludes the origin; `message.add` needs
  `workspace.manage`.
- Mock agent support for `e2e:mcp:kandev:propose_task_kandev({...})`.

The settings-page and copilot halves of `AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-005.1`
are built in tasks 02 and 06; this work order owns the criterion because the
route's 409 and the session-start check are the enforcement.

## Out of scope

- Approve and reject routes, claim, recovery, the reserved external-id prefix
  (task 07).
- Any UI (tasks 02, 04, 05, 06, 08).
- Containment of the agent CLI's own tools (gate G3).

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

Screenshots (visual reference; the acceptance criteria govern):

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png`](assets/p1-05-chat-create-task-proposal.png)

Mockup scenario specs to port (in the workspace-coordinator analysis
mockup's `mockup/e2e/tests/`, outside this repository; see the plan's [Mockup scenario to repo test](plan.md#mockup-scenario-to-repo-test)):

- None ported as Playwright here: this work order is backend only. The tool-call and proposal behaviour `p1-05` shows is covered by the Go tests below and ported as Playwright in tasks 06 and 08.

## Acceptance

- With the mock agent, a coordinator session lists tasks and writes one
  `pending` proposal; no task is created and every other Kandev action is
  refused with its name.
- No path other than a manager's `message.add` starts or resumes the
  conversation session, and the session never starts in the regular task mode.
- Auto-approval covers only the coordinator tools, regardless of the profile's
  `auto_approve` or `AGENTCTL_AUTO_APPROVE_PERMISSIONS`, on first launch,
  re-created, resumed and promoted executions.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/coordinator/... ./internal/mcp/... ./internal/agentctl/... ./internal/task/... ./internal/orchestrator/...
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/mcp/handlers/ -run 'TestCoordinator' -count=1
cd apps/backend && make lint
```

Required Go tests:

- a table over every registered Kandev MCP action: only allowlisted actions
  run for a coordinator principal;
- `Legacy` instance and `SetMcpMode` from task mode both list exactly the
  coordinator tools, with no user-question, title or plugin tool;
- foreign workspace ids refused, including a `workspace_id` argument other
  than the principal's to `list_workflows_kandev` and
  `list_repositories_kandev` (refused before the handler runs, no data
  returned); non-coordinator principal refused for the
  proposal action; HTTP and MCP create refuse the origin;
- a `workspace.read` member's `message.add` on the conversation task is
  refused and starts no turn, while a `workspace.manage` member's succeeds
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-002.3`);
- 30 concurrent proposes against an empty coordinator leave exactly 25 open
  on SQLite and PostgreSQL;
- a racing coordinator delete during a conversation open returns 404 and
  leaves no task, both before step 4 and after it (the route's step 7
  re-read finds no row and deletes the task, an already-deleted task counting
  as done); an ensure failure whose re-read finds no row returns 404, not 502;
- the prepared conversation session's agent and executor profiles equal the
  coordinator's while the workspace default agent profile differs;
- a coordinator-origin session with `config_mode` metadata still resolves the
  coordinator mode and six-tool profile; with the flag on, a start whose task
  row is absent but is some coordinator's `conversation_task_id` fails with no
  instance, and a lookup error fails it too;
- `handleSetMcpMode` accepts `coordinator` (200) and an unknown mode's 400
  lists `coordinator`;
- a config-mode session whose `GetTask` returns a read error (not
  `ErrTaskNotFound`) fails with no instance; a config-mode session with no
  row and no coordinator match, and one with a readable non-coordinator
  task, still resolve config mode and the configuration profile; a non-config
  session with no row and no match gets the not-found error for the
  `ErrTaskNotFound` form and the `Legacy` profile for the nil-task form; with
  no row and a lookup match, both forms fail with no instance, config-mode
  sessions included (every "no row" case runs once with a fake returning
  `ErrTaskNotFound` and once with one returning a nil task);
- each of the two lookup-wired resolvers (`main.go`, `registerMCPAndDebugRoutes`)
  resolves a coordinator conversation task to `SurfaceCoordinator` and its
  coordinator, and refuses it when built without the lookup;
- a prepared conversation session whose lookup is then removed, and
  separately whose agent profile then goes missing, gets an error from the
  promoting launch and no agent subprocess;
- `GetWorkspaceInfoForSession` returns `McpMode` `coordinator` for a
  conversation session, empty for a Kanban session, empty with no error when
  the task read returns `ErrTaskNotFound`, and an error for any other task
  read error;
- two racing opens against the new `conversation_task_id` conditional-UPDATE
  return the same task and one session, and the losing task is deleted, on
  SQLite and PostgreSQL (`KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`), matching task 01's and
  task 04's dual-dialect coverage of their own conditional-update methods; an
  open of a live task with no session creates one `CREATED`
  session with no agent; an ensure failure returns 502 and the next open
  retries with the same task; the created task carries no
  `auto_start_on_create` marker, and no agent runs after create or open;
- a zero-row update at step 4 whose re-read finds `conversation_task_id` NULL
  deletes the task just created, returns 409 and leaves no orphaned task; the
  next open retries and succeeds with the fresh value;
- a context change archives the old conversation task (a running turn
  stops), the next open creates a new one, and the archived one never
  resolves to a coordinator; a changed `agent_profile_id` or
  `executor_profile_id` archives the old conversation task the same way and
  the next open's task and session carry the newly saved profiles
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-002.10`), while sending either profile id
  back unchanged keeps the conversation; coordinator delete removes current
  and archived conversation tasks and all proposals, and leaves untouched a
  task seeded
  with a `coordinator-proposal:`-prefixed external id and an `approved`
  proposal row created directly through task 01's store (not through task
  07's approve route, which this work order does not depend on)
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-002.8`); the startup cleanup deletes a task
  with an unknown `coordinator_id`, archives an unreferenced unarchived one,
  and changes nothing on a second run; a conversation task created at or
  after `T0` is left alone, and an already-deleted or already-archived task
  counts as done;
- a conversation task idle for eight days is not listed or deleted by Quick
  Chat expiry, on SQLite and PostgreSQL, while an ordinary quick chat still is;
- flag off, missing row, unreadable task, passthrough or missing agent
  profile, missing executor profile: no start, and the conversation route
  returns 409 with the `coordinator_profile_unavailable` body carrying both
  statuses (a table over agent `missing`, agent `passthrough`, executor
  `missing` and agent `passthrough` with executor `missing`); a profile read
  error other than not found returns 500 from the route and starts nothing;
- `mcp__kandev__list_tasks_kandev` auto-approved and
  `mcp__kandev__move_task_kandev` not, with the profile flag and the
  environment variable set, on each lifecycle path;
- `auto_resume_allowed` false; conversation route sends no prompt; a table
  over every backend path that can start a turn (stall and
  `workspace.deleted` subscribers, proposal decisions, startup recovery,
  session recovery on restart) shows none starts the session:
  `TestCoordinatorConversationNoTurnStart` in
  `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/no_turn_start_test.go`, rows in the
  package-level slice `noTurnStartPaths`, created here; whichever of
  tasks 03, 04 and 07 merges last into this table adds the rows for the
  paths owned by the other two, so the table is complete regardless of merge
  order;
- propose with the step omitted uses the workflow's start step
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-001.2`); propose refuses an empty or over-60
  title, an over-10,000-character description and rationale, a source task
  outside the coordinator's workspace, and a workflow outside the
  coordinator's workspace, each naming its field
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-PROPOSALS-001.3`'s length and cross-workspace clauses, not
  only the step-eligibility clauses below); propose refuses an auto-start
  step, a foreign repository, a step that is neither start nor manual-move, a
  step that feeds an auto-start step directly or through a chain of
  `pull_from_step_id` links, a 26th open proposal; two identical calls make
  two proposals; each successful propose publishes one `coordinator.updated`;
- when the conversation task no longer exists (deleted by an operator or a
  concurrent workspace cleanup between reads), the next open creates a new
  conversation task and session rather than erroring
  (`AC-COORDINATOR-COPILOT-001.3`), distinct from the archived-task case
  above, since a deleted task is never re-read as the coordinator's current
  reference in the first place.

## Dependencies

- Task 01 (store, types, constants, event, flag). While G0 is open the branch
  starts from task 01's branch and rebases onto main after each predecessor
  merges.
- Several open PRs, including #2756, #2841, #2909, #2974, #3048, #3155 and
  #3165, also edit `internal/mcp`; whichever lands second rebases. This list
  is not exhaustive and no dependency either way is assumed; the
  implementation checks main for a name already taken (D7).

## Risks

- A future MCP action added without updating the guard: the table test fails
  closed by design.
- The permission override must be explicit `false`, not absent, or the
  environment variable wins.
