# Task 04: Needs You, Queue, Stall Records and Sidebar (WP-3)

## Summary

Render each coordinator's Needs you and Queue from task facts, stall records
and open proposals, with the count strip, sidebar entries and badge. Proposal
cards render read-only from task 01's proposals route until task 08 adds the
decisions. Nothing on these screens writes. Runs in parallel with tasks 02, 03
and 07.

## In scope

- Backend, in the subscribers registration function of
  `backendapp/coordinator.go`: `task.stalled` subscriber (coordinated
  workspaces only, through task 01's fenced stall upsert, publishing
  `coordinator.updated` on a change), startup pruning, and the
  `workspace.deleted` subscriber. The stalls table and route are task 01's.
- Web: routes and resolver; `lib/coordinator/attention.ts`; `app/coordinator/`
  screens (header, selector, strip, item card with phase 1 actions, Queue
  groups, empty, missing and error states, with the tasks input's failure
  and load time read from `workspaceContextRead` and partial snapshots
  classified); sidebar entries as the Coordinators section in `app-sidebar/sections/coordinators-section.tsx` (replacing the primary-nav rows; #3981 owner request 2026-09-30) and
  `MobileRequiredRows`; the badge store and `coordinator.updated` handler;
  six locales. With the flag off no sidebar entry or Coordinator route renders.
- The header's **Configure** action links to the settings coordinator page at
  `/settings/workspaces/:id/coordinators/:coordinatorId` whether or not task
  02's page has merged into this branch ("unconditionally" refers to the href
  target only). Like **Add a coordinator**, it renders only for a manager:
  `hasScope(workspace.scopes, SCOPE.workspaceManage)`
  (`apps/web/lib/types/team-access.ts`); a `workspace.read` viewer sees
  neither. The settings page is declared in the
  [coordinators design](../../specs/coordinator/system-design/coordinators.md#settings-ui)
  and built by task 02. A component test asserts the href regardless of whether
  task 02 has merged into this branch; the page itself is task 02's to build.
- Go tests seed proposal rows through task 01's store, since
  `propose_task_kandev` (task 03) may not have landed.
- Whichever of tasks 03, 04 and 07 merges last into task 03's no-turn-start
  table (`noTurnStartPaths` in
  `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/no_turn_start_test.go`, run by
  `TestCoordinatorConversationNoTurnStart`) adds the rows for the paths owned by the other two (task 04's stall
  and `workspace.deleted` subscribers here), so the table is complete
  regardless of merge order.
- The `@axe-core/playwright` dependency (new to `apps/web/package.json`) and a
  shared `apps/web/e2e/helpers/axe.ts` wrapping `AxeBuilder`, used by
  `mobile-needs-you.spec.ts` below to satisfy
  `AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-008.2`.

## Out of scope

- The copilot launcher and **Ask about this** behaviour (task 06). This task
  renders **Ask about this** on every item as a native `disabled` button with
  no click handler, keeping its 44px target; task 06 enables and wires it.
- Approve, Edit and Reject (task 08).
- Resume, merge prompts, answering in place (later phases).

## Mockup screenshots and scenarios

Screenshots (visual reference; the acceptance criteria govern):

- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-01-needs-you.png`](assets/p1-01-needs-you.png)
- [`docs/plans/workspace-coordinator/assets/p1-03-queue.png`](assets/p1-03-queue.png)

Mockup scenario specs to port (in the workspace-coordinator analysis
mockup's `mockup/e2e/tests/`, outside this repository; see the plan's [Mockup scenario to repo test](plan.md#mockup-scenario-to-repo-test)):

- `01-morning-check.spec.ts`: screens, count strip, item card structure, sidebar entry.
- `06-stalled-child.spec.ts` (evidence): stall card and evidence from a real `task.stalled`.
- `07-empty-is-success.spec.ts`: the empty, missing and error states.
- `14-first-run-setup.spec.ts` (uncoordinated part): no coordinator, Inbox kept, generic entry, no strip.
- `18-v21-copilot-anywhere.spec.ts`, phase 1 list assertions: phase 1 kinds and actions only.

## Acceptance

- Both screens render a real workspace with every classification group, in the
  specified order, and update without reload when task facts change.
- A real `task.stalled` (not seeded) produces a stall card with its evidence in
  a coordinated workspace, and nothing in an uncoordinated one.
- With no coordinator the Inbox row is unchanged, the generic entry has no
  badge and there is no strip; phone and axe checks pass.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/coordinator/... ./internal/backendapp/...
cd apps/web && pnpm test -- lib/coordinator/attention.test.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run i18n:check
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run tests/coordinator/needs-you.spec.ts tests/coordinator/stall.spec.ts tests/coordinator/empty-states.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:run --project=mobile-chrome tests/coordinator/mobile-needs-you.spec.ts
```

A component test on the item card covers task 04's own share of
`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-002.8`: with a `workspace.manage` viewer and with a
`workspace.read` viewer, the item shows the identical read-only card (title,
description, target and "Proposed by" line, no decision actions for either
role), since task 04 renders no Approve, Edit or Reject control at all (see
"Out of scope" above). The AC's manage-viewer half ("the actions defined by
proposals.md") lands with task 08, whose own `use-proposals.test.ts`
component test already covers the `workspace.read`-vs-`workspace.manage`
contrast on the shared `ProposalCard` directly. Task 02's
`tests/auth/coordinator-settings-reader.spec.ts` is the coordinator suite's
one `auth`-project Playwright spec; this reader-gating check does not need a
second one.

The `mobile-chrome` project matches on the `mobile-*.spec.ts` filename prefix
(`apps/web/e2e/playwright.config.ts`), not on project scope, so the 390px and
axe assertions live in their own `mobile-needs-you.spec.ts` file rather than a
rerun of `needs-you.spec.ts` under a different project. That file also carries
the accessibility scan required by `AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-008.2`, using the
`@axe-core/playwright` `AxeBuilder` helper at `apps/web/e2e/helpers/axe.ts`
(new in this task) and asserting no critical violation on both screens.

The stall spec restarts the e2e backend with
`KANDEV_TASK_STALL_DETECTION_THRESHOLD` set to seconds and a task holding an
execution-less active session, so the one-minute sweep publishes
`task.stalled`. Vitest covers every group, each precedence pair, equal
timestamps, a missing `last_activity_at`, an absent `statusSummary` with and
without a stall row (stall item, and Other with "session unreadable"), an
absent `statusSummary` with `state == "COMPLETED"` (Done, not Other: the
Done rule reads the task's own state, not the status summary), and the
error why-text with an active error, with only a task error that has a
preview ("The task failed"), and with only an empty task error.

Go tests cover the stall upsert: a newer `last_event_at` replaces the row and
publishes `coordinator.updated`; an equal one (redelivery) and an earlier one
(out of order) change nothing and publish nothing, on SQLite and PostgreSQL
(`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-005.1`). With a bus whose publish fails for the
first of two coordinators, the row is written and the second coordinator's
event is still published.

Go tests cover startup pruning (`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-005.3`): seeding a
stall row detected 31 days ago, a row whose task is archived, a row whose task
is deleted outright, and a row detected within the last 30 days for a live
task, then running the startup pass asserts the first three rows are gone and
the fourth survives unchanged, on SQLite and PostgreSQL.

Go tests cover the `workspace.deleted` subscriber
(`AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-006.1`): deleting a workspace with a coordinator
seeded with proposals in every status and stall rows removes the coordinator,
its proposals and its stall records in one transaction, and its conversation
tasks are deleted with the workspace's other tasks; a repeated deletion event
for the same workspace changes nothing. This test seeds its own coordinator,
proposal and stall rows through task 01's store rather than depending on task
07's approve flow.

A component test covers the tasks input: with one workflow snapshot loaded and
another failing, the lists and counts show the loaded workflow's tasks and the
banner shows; the load time is absent before the first success; **Try again**
calls `requestWorkspaceContextRefresh` and only the failed workflow is
re-fetched; with no snapshot loaded and a failed read, the banner replaces the
lists and strip.

A component test on the header and the no-coordinator state covers the
manager gating of `AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-006.5` and
`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-007.2`: with `workspace.manage` in the workspace's
scopes, **Configure** (with the settings href above) and **Add a coordinator**
render; with only `workspace.read`, neither renders.

A component test covers the unknown coordinator id
(`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-006.4`): with one coordinator in the workspace, an
unknown id shows "This coordinator is not in this workspace." and **See
coordinators** linking to `/settings/workspaces/:id/coordinators`, with no
strip and no **Add a coordinator**; with none, it shows the no-coordinator
state; with a failing coordinator list read, it shows "Could not load
coordinators." and **Try again** re-reads the list.

A component test covers the stall-record and proposal inputs
(`AC-COORDINATOR-NEEDS-YOU-007.3`, `007.5`): with tasks loaded, a failing
stalls read shows only the stall-records line (timeless on a first load, with
the last load time after a success) and the lists without stall items; a
failing proposals read shows only the proposals line; both failing show both
lines in the order tasks, stall records, proposals; **Try again** re-issues
only the failed reads, and each line clears when its own read succeeds.

A component test asserts **Ask about this** renders on each item kind and is
`disabled`.

A component test on `coordinators-section.tsx` asserts the flag-off case
directly: with `features.coordinator` off, no coordinator sidebar entry
renders and `spa-routes.tsx` does not register the `/coordinator` route, so
the absence in the "In scope" summary above is a checked assertion, not an
inference from other tests.

## Adoption decisions

Recorded when this work order was adopted against main at `dfce4dac0` plus
task 01's branch. Each one fills a detail the specifications leave to the
implementation; none changes an acceptance criterion.

1. **Card identifier.** The task DTO already sends `identifier` (for example
   `KAN-42`); the web `Task` type and `toKanbanTask` do not carry it yet. This
   task adds `identifier` to both. An item or row shows the identifier, or the
   task title when the identifier is empty (tasks created before identifiers
   were assigned).
2. **Open-task filter in the client.** Ephemeral tasks never reach
   `kanbanMulti.snapshots` (`useAllWorkflowSnapshots` drops `is_ephemeral`),
   and the client field for `archived_at` is `isArchived`. `classify` excludes
   `isArchived === true`. A stall row or a proposal source task whose task id
   is not in the snapshots is treated as absent: the stall is ignored and the
   proposal head reads "New task".
3. **Current step.** The step shown on an item or row is the name of the
   task's `workflowStepId` in its workflow snapshot's steps; an unknown step id
   shows no step.
4. **Agent running now** (stall evidence) is `primary_session.state` in
   `RUNNING` or `STARTING`; unreadable or absent reads as not running.
5. **Subscriber lifecycle.** `registerCoordinatorSubscribers` subscribes to
   `task.stalled` and `workspace.deleted` when it is called (after routes
   register, so no event after T0 is missed) and returns the startup pruning
   pass as its hook. Subscriptions are released when the app context ends.
   The function is only reached when `features.coordinator` is on, so with the
   flag off nothing subscribes.
6. **`coordinator.updated` after a stall change** is published once per
   coordinator of the workspace, ordered by the list order of
   `AC-COORDINATOR-COORDINATORS-003.1`, each carrying that coordinator's
   `CountOpenProposals` result. A failed count logs at warn and skips that
   coordinator's event; the stall row stays written.
7. **`workspace.deleted`** reads the workspace id from the payload's `id` key.
   The event is published after the workspace's tasks are deleted, so the
   conversation tasks are already gone. A new store method deletes the
   workspace's stall rows, proposals and coordinators in one transaction and
   succeeds with no rows, which makes a repeated event a no-op. It publishes
   nothing.
8. **Screen refresh on `coordinator.updated`.** For the viewed workspace, any
   `coordinator.updated` replaces that coordinator's badge value and re-reads
   stalls and the viewed coordinator's pending proposals. Concurrent re-reads
   are not deduplicated: the response to the latest request wins, and older
   responses are discarded.
9. **Age timer.** One 30-second interval per mounted screen re-evaluates
   `now`; ages render in whole minutes as `<h>h <m>m`, or `<m>m` under an hour,
   and "0m" for a reference time in the future.
10. **Proposals read before task 08.** `app/coordinator/use-coordinator-inputs.ts`
    (see the design's Inputs) reads the viewed coordinator's pending proposals
    through `listProposals` alongside the stall records. This task does not
    create `hooks/domains/coordinator/use-proposals.ts`; task 08 creates it and
    moves the proposals input there, removing the hook's proposals read.

## Likely files

- `apps/backend/internal/coordinator/{stalls,workspace_deleted}.go` and tests
- `apps/web/src/spa-routes.tsx`
- `apps/web/lib/coordinator/attention.ts` and test
- `apps/web/app/coordinator/`, including `use-coordinator-inputs.ts`
- `apps/web/components/app-sidebar/app-sidebar-primary-nav.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/app-sidebar/sections/coordinators-section.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/navigation/mobile-sidebar-layout-navigation.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/navigation/mobile-coordinators-section.tsx` (phone menu section matching the desktop one; #3981 owner request 2026-09-30)
- `apps/web/src/locales/*/`
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/coordinator/`, including `mobile-needs-you.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/helpers/axe.ts`

## Dependencies

- Task 01 (stalls and proposals tables, routes, `coordinator.updated`,
  `open_proposals`, client). While G0 is open the branch starts from task 01's
  branch and rebases onto main after each predecessor merges.

## Risks

- A stall-driven e2e test is slow; keep it to one spec and avoid sleeps by
  waiting on the rendered card.
- Workflow snapshots must be loaded for every workflow of the workspace, or
  counts undercount.
