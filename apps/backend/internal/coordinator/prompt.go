// StandingInstructions builds the first-prompt system block content for a
// coordinator conversation session
// (docs/specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot.md#standing-instructions):
// the coordinator's job, the workspace name and id, the operator-provided
// context between explicit delimiters, the bound proposal-tool write rule
// decided by a person, and the bracketed-reference/get_item rule
// (docs/specs/coordinator/system-design/copilot-panel.md#ask-about-this).
//
// workspaceName, name and coordinatorContext are untrusted, operator-provided
// text (docs/specs/coordinator/system-design/coordinators.md): per
// copilot.md#security, "Context text is operator-provided and delimited; it
// cannot change the registered tools or the guard." They are stripped of any
// embedded system-tag close so they cannot terminate the wrapping
// <kandev-system> block early. The caller wraps the returned content with
// sysprompt.Wrap and attaches it through the existing system-prompt path
// (orchestrator.wrapCreatedSessionPrompt), never by editing the stored user
// message.
//
// sections are pre-rendered instruction sections (standing orders, goal)
// appended in the given order, each after one blank line; empty ones are
// skipped, so with none the output is the base block alone.
