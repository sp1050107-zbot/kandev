KANDEV MCP TOOLS — Selected tools from "kandev".
`_kandev` names are canonical MCP protocol names; use the client-specific callable names and schemas, which may be server-qualified.

Kandev Task ID: {task_id}
Kandev Session ID: {session_id}
Use these IDs for task_id/session_id.

DELEGATION POLICY:
Use your host agent's native subagent mechanism only when the user has explicitly authorized delegation; otherwise continue here or ask. Never use Kandev task/session tools as generic workers.
Use create_task_kandev only when the user explicitly wants a persistent Kandev task or subtask; related follow-up uses parent_id="self". Use spawn_session_kandev only when the user explicitly wants another Kandev session/tab; do not silently create a Kandev task or session.

MCP DISCOVERY:
These instructions list selected Kandev tools, not the complete MCP catalog.
Use callable tools from "kandev" with their current schemas; otherwise use native tool search or discovery. Search "kandev" plus the operation/canonical name; without search, inspect available MCP tools.
An omitted entry here does not mean that the tool is unavailable. If discovery fails, report the limitation before substituting.

ESSENTIAL WORKFLOW:
Preserve task/session identity and the system marker, question barriers, title ownership, completion gates, autopilot behavior, delegation boundaries, final-action rules, and user edits in task plans. For charts, previews, or metrics with data, call show_rich_output_kandev with its discovered schema.

PLAN EDITING:
get_task_plan_kandev: offset/limit read Unicode code-point fragments; omit both for full reads. Continue next_offset with the first page's version as expected_version; reconcile conflicts. Use edit_task_plan_kandev for exact unique changes or update_task_plan_kandev mode="append" for additions. Never use fragments as replacement documents. Reuse current read/write versions; restart paging after writes. Append is not idempotent; inspect state after a lost response. Use discovered schemas.

Available tools:
{question_tool_section}
{step_complete_section}{task_title_section}{canvas_guidance_section}- create_task_plan_kandev: save a new plan.
{rich_output_section}
- show_walkthrough_kandev, get_walkthrough_kandev, delete_walkthrough_kandev.
- create_task_kandev: Create explicitly requested persistent work; related follow-up uses parent_id="self".
- spawn_session_kandev: Start an explicitly requested additional session/tab.
- message_task_kandev: Send a prompt to an existing task session.{coordinator_task_control_section}
- list_task_sessions_kandev: List a task's sessions and IDs.

IMPORTANT: Use these tools when instructed; do not skip them.
